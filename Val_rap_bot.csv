Lyrics
"So, me and Krizz Kaliko check into our uh... hotel in Paris, France. We were there for the first time, you know, it's in 2010 and our hotel was so fucking rinkydink that when we checked in our room -- it was so small that you open the front door to our room and you could see, hold up --  You could see the nigga at the front desk. He was like, you just open the door and he was right there. So Krizz Kaliko goes and asks the nigga like, uh, ey man, y'all got the WiFi? And the dude was like ""wh- WiFi? WiFi? I dunno, WiFi?"" ""You know, WiFi man, you got WiFi? WiFi code?"" He's like ""WiFi? No, we don't have WiFi."" He's like ""you know, like internet, like phone"" and he's like ""ohhh, Weefee, Weefee, yeah we got Weefee."""
"You know when... You let somebody borrow some money? 
 And then you ask for it back, and they get mad? 
 What the fuck! 
 Bro, I was nice enough to give you my money, and now you taking pics like you got it when you don't, and plus you don't want to pay me back? 
 You crazy! 
  
 I've been having problems with police lately 
 I've been having problems with my old lady 
 I've been having problems, tryna sleep 
 All these niggas on the street owe me money but they never pay me 
 I've been having problems with police lately 
 I've been having problems with my old lady 
 I've been having problems, tryna sleep 
 All these niggas on the street owe me money but they never pay me 
  
 I've been having problems tryna get it back (back) 
 Niggas borrow money, ask for a whole stack (stack) 
 Niggas wanna act like they ain't got it then you help 'em with the money they don't ever wanna pay it back (back) 
 Niggas steady acting like they broke (hah) 
 Talking like they want it but they don't (hah) 
 Steady taking pictures for the gram but when I tell 'em get my money they be saying ""leaving me 'lone"" 
 How gonna take a pic and try to flex 
 How you spend it on that ice on your neck 
 You the reason that my ass goin' crazy 
 You the reason I've been having problems lately 
  
 I've been having problems with police lately 
 I've been having problems with my old lady 
 I've been having problems, tryna sleep 
 All these niggas on the street owe me money but they never pay me 
 I've been having problems with police lately 
 I've been having problems with my old lady 
 I've been having problems, tryna sleep 
 All these niggas on the street owe me money but they never pay me 
  
 If you ain't pay me then run it back 
 If you ain't pay me then where you at 
 If you ain't pay me, you crazy, please don't play me I'm bringing Dax type niggas to get you back 
 Need my money to make a track 
 Need that money to make it smack 
 Need that money, not funny, now I gotta go funny to help me raise some money to rap 
  
 Man, just... Pay me my money man"

"Pewdiepie, go die 
 Pewdiepie, go die 
 Pewdiepie, go die 
  
 First diss was a teaser, now I'm coming for blood 
 First Rice, now the leader, I'm the internet thug 
 I ain't scared of you neither, 'cause a couple of subs 
 YouTube still my jungle, and I do it for fun 
 Pewdiepie 'bout to die, started strong and now you wack 
 OG in the game, but it's time to give me that 
 I ain't doing it for fame, fans told me make a track 
 Little fans gonna hate, 'cause I'm finna flame yo' ass 
 Pewdiepie, go die 
 Videos getting boring, time to find a new hobby 
 See yo' ass on the street, type of white boy, guess ya name was Bobby 
 Ya mom call me ""Papi,"" I'll beat you like Rocky 
 Pewdiepie, go die 
 I'll beat you like Rocky, ain't no way you could stop me 
 Caught your bitch at a party, she top me so sloppy 
 Might be pregnant, no mommy 
 Pewdiepie 
 Where you at, where you at? Finna find yo' ass, wanna watch you cry 
 Take the ""P"" out of ""Pie,"" switch to a ""D,"" Pewdie and go die 
 Videos in a room, need to switch it up, going out of style 
 Ricegum, type of guy tried to get it popping, probably won't reply 
 Prick, you a dick, you ain't gotta say I'm lit 
 You and Rice faked a fight, so I took you both, turnt you to my bitch 
 They gon' say I ride the wave, dropping niggas' names, flexing to be rich 
 But I ain't caring what they say, still spit flames and I'm still the shit 
 Pewdiepie, go die 
 Fuck you and ya fan base, one question: how my ass taste? 
 They gon' hate and say I'm mad fake, but I ain't human, I'm in outer space 
 I ain't hear a single word they say, too high for those Pewdie lames 
 Pewdiepie go die 
 Pewdiepie go die 
 Pewdiepie go die, die die die die die die 
 Pewdie go die, die die die die die die 
  
 This is for the rest of the world, here is my plan 
 I'ma manifest my dreams and turn you into a fan 
 No matter what, I'll succeed, the decision is in my hands 
 And I'm telling you in advance that Dax is gon' be the man 
 Follow me or follow me 
 Choices that you got in a world that's full of monopoly 
 No matter if you hate it or love it, ya boy is profiting 
 Can't deny the quality 
 So haters, if you hating, I beg that you hate, honestly 
 Clickbait, I'ma keep on doing that shit till you think straight 
 I don't care about the etiquette, the views great 
 Got my pockets feeling heavy, bodybuilder weight 
 All you haters is supplying for my family 
 I won't stop, you gon' have to kill me 
 Dax is spitting facts is how I know that you gon' feel me 
 Only rapper out who truly's acting like the real me 
 Conscious but my content isn't nonsense, straight filthy 
 I don't feel guilty for killing these fucking YouTubers 
 Listen, I don't feel guilty for killing these fucking YouTubers"
"I like big booty bitches rappin and Lynard Skynyrd 
 Cases of beer cold as a Kansas City winter 
 Drink to get drunk then find a chick and put dick off in her 
 Then make her take me shopping for kicks at Harold Pener 
 My family gave me rock, my family gave me rap 
 The streets gave me guap, the streets gave me straps 
 Black bitches fuck me, white bitches love me 
 Trust me I do em both at the same time rough as rugby 
 Do em both to Bon Jovi, and then to Public Enemy 
 Energy in me definitively I'm on Hennessy and then I'm on Jimmy B 
 I used to have red spikes at raves, and then turn around havin blue and red fights with k's 
 Your parents got a cold shiver cause a pot of gold hit a fatha gorilla that's a dolla go getta 
 And he's an awesome flow spitta 
 Your daughter goes with a guy who loathes millers 
 Why? 
  
 Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga 
 They don't understand me 
 God naturally tanned me 
 You don't like it I can be a nigga 
 Rockin 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin when they eyes hit this rock n roll nigga 
 And I ain't changin, got my slipknot bangin and I 
 Swear to God I ain't never ever giving up 
 Fried chicken wings and Coors Light nigga what? 
  
 High school hung with a white bruha 
 Came home then I went straight to Jumu'ah 
 Then after that I put back on my red puma 
 Then bark at a chick the same height and color as Uhma 
 And we get the lead out to Zeplin we blow the bed out 
 Got a call from one of the homies in trouble so yo we sped out 
 Got to the hood and found a rivalry took his head out 
 We had to show them evil motherfuckers what that red bout 
 Until we find the killers you know we will search 
 For those who kill first we gon let the steel squirt 
 And this mentality's valid because we real hurt 
 To ease the pain I listen to Getty, Alex and Neil Pert 
 Growin up it was a chore, cause I gravitated towards stuff the homies ignored 
 Like trippin off bad brains when on my skateboard 
 Even more, I named my gangsta rap label after The Doors! 
  
 Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga 
 They don't understand me 
 God naturally tanned me 
 You don't like it I can be a nigga 
 Rockin 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin when they eyes hit this rock n roll nigga 
 And I ain't changin, got my slipknot bangin and I 
 Swear to God I ain't never ever giving up 
 Fried chicken wings and Coors Light nigga what? 
  
 My momma made me, raised me 
 Played me 80's made me crazy 
 My father played me crazy made me aid me vaugly praised me 
 But I'm a real with a lotta will 
 Remembered I would kill for a dolla bill 
 But that all changed with strange man I gotta deal. 
 Like every scholar in the game, got alotta mil 
 Still a riot maker fuckin bring the house down 
 Who that gang bangin rocker with the loud sound 
 That's Tecca Nina with the shit that make them broads hound 
 Telekinesis with my speeches get them drawers down 
 And that goes for the grand dragon daughters too 
 And the Neo-Soul conscious chicks they wanna swallow who? 
 The show gritter and yo little low wigger ' 
 Better not be caught with no sitta 
  
 Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga 
 They don't understand me 
 God naturally tanned me 
 You don't like it I can be a nigga 
 Rockin 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin when they eyes hit this rock n roll nigga 
 And I ain't changin, got my slipknot bangin and I 
 Swear to God I ain't never ever giving up 
 Fried chicken wings and Coors Light nigga what?"
"It was all a dream 
  
 Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racing through my head 
 Felt so real to me, this is what was said 
  
 ""Had a dream,"" I said; ""'bout who?"" he said 
 ""'Bout B.I.G.,"" I said; ""That's big,"" he said 
 ""Dig what he said"". ""Proceed,"" he said 
 ""Indeed,"" I said, so, breathe I did 
 ""Don't repeat what I say,"" I said, he said nothing 
 He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this 
 What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said 
 ""It came to me like a whisper last evening,"" I said 
 ""What's the deal, playboy?"" was the greeting he said 
 First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead 
 ""'Mo' Money Mo' Problems'. Better believe it,"" he said 
 ""Careful what you wish for, you might receive it,"" he said 
 ""I see,"" I said, ""jealousy,"" I said 
 ""Got the whole industry mad at me,"" I said 
 Then B.I. said, ""Hov, remind yourself: 
 Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"" 
 ""I agree,"" I said, ""my one-of-a-kind self."" 
 Getting stoned every day like Jesus did 
 ""What he said,"" I said, ""has been said before."" 
 ""Just keep doing your thing,"" he said, ""say no more."" 
  
 Was it all a dream - tell me 
 Was it all a dream, was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream 
 I gotta know (It was all a dream) 
 Was it all a dream - was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream, a dream 
 Was it all a dream 
  
 It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine 
 Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
 Hanging pictures on my wall 
 Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
 I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped 
 Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock 
 Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
 With the hat to match 
 Remember Rapping Duke, ""duh-ha, duh-ha"" 
 You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far 
 Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight 
 Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade) 
 Born sinner, the opposite of a winner 
 Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner 
 Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri 
 Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky 
 I'm blowing up like you thought I would 
 Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good 
 And if you don't know, now you know, nigga 
  
 Was it all a dream - tell me 
 Was it all a dream, was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream 
 I gotta know (It was all a dream) 
 Was it all a dream - was it a dream 
 Was it all a dream, a dream 
 Was it all a dream 
  
 ""I see,"" I said, ""jealousy,"" I said 
 ""Got the whole industry mad at me,"" I said 
 Then B.I. said, ""Hov, remind yourself: 
 Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"" 
 ""I agree,"" I said, ""my one-of-a-kind self"" 
 Getting stoned every day like Jesus did 
 ""What he said,"" I said, ""has been said before."" 
 ""Just keep doing your thing,"" he said; ""say no more."""
"You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards 
 You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards 
 But I won't back down 
 Oh no, I won't back down, oh no 
  
 Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles 
 Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels 
 Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail 
 Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel 
 What I do, I do at will 
 Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill 
 Half a breath left on my deathbed 
 Screamin', ""F that!"" - yeah, super-ill 
 Baby, what the deal? We can chill 
 Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal 
 Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off 
 And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill 
 Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you 
 To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill 
 How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable? 
 Summer's Eve, Massengill 
 Shady's got the mass appeal 
 Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam 
 You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact 
 Well, shorty, I'm that man 
 These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man 
 I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium 
 And said, ""Settle your fuckin' ass down! 
 I'm ready for combat, man!"" 
 Get it? Calm Batman, nah 
 Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts 
 Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans 
 'Cause they fuckin' go bananas 
 Honey, I applaud that ass 
 Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance 
 Ma, show 'em how it's done 
 Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah 
  
 You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards 
 You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards 
 But I won't back down 
 Oh no, I won't back down, oh no 
  
 Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's 
 Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers 
 Playin' with an etch-a-sketch 
 Bet you that you'll never guess 
 Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors 
 Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced 
 Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads 
 With Chris's force like you pissed him off 
 Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker 
 You ain't got a lick in yours 
 Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores 
 Makin' cash registers shit their drawers 
 Think you spit the rawest? 
 I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor 
 Other words, I'm off the meat rack 
 Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords 
 I'ma measure my dick-shit, I need six inches more 
 Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you 
 That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig? 
 You're addicted, I'm dope 
 I'm the longest needle around here-need a fix, ock? 
 I'm the big shot-get it, dick-snots? 
 You're just small pokes, little pricks 
 Girl, you think that other prick's hot? 
 I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match 
 Before I sit back and let him get hotter 
 Better call the cops on him quick, fast 
 Shady's right back on your bitch-ass 
 White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback 
 Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch 
  
 You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards 
 You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards 
 But I won't back down 
 Oh no, I won't back down, oh no 
  
 Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'? 
 Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp 
 'Til he burps and smoke purp? 
 Does a word search get circles wrapped around it 
 Like you do when I come through? 
 I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do 
 When I'm on the mic 
 Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to 
 Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football 
 Been this way since I stood a foot tall 
 You're a good catch with a shitty spouse 
 Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw 
 Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain 
 Don't want no cum stain-bitch, you listenin'? 
 Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you 
 Turn me back up! Are you insane?! 
 Tryin' to talk over me in the car 
 Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'! 
 I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life 
 What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning 
 And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place 
 Then how the fuck have I been hit six times 
 In three different locations on four separate occasions? 
 And you can bet your stankin' ass 
 That I've come to smash everything in my path 
 Fork was in the road, took the psycho path 
 Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash 
 So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty 
 On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty! 
 I'm the shit-why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""? 
  
 You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards 
 You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards 
 But I won't back down 
 Oh no, I won't back down, oh no"
"Peace y'all, yeah 
 This one right here goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal, loyal ones 
 You for me and me for you 
 We see things alike 
 We live alike, in truth 
  
 The craziest things already happened, get me 
 Could tell you gon' be laughing at me or you laughing with me? 
 My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me 
 In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin' 
 Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman 
 Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth 
 Was she looking for fame? yo I hope she got it 
 Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target 
 All women should bid 
 For keeping real fathers away from their kids 
 These rappers talkin' real shit I lived 
 How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin' 
 Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand 
 Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner 
 Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer 
 Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us 
 She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her 
 Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers 
 She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em 
 Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me 
 Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad 
 Tell you lames something, spit some game 
 Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain? 
 When you place blame, then you're defective 
 When you take blame, then you're respected 
 You gotta give me credit 
  
 Whoa 
 Life is good, I must admit it 
 Whoa 
 Ups and downs, we've all been through it 
 Whoa 
 Ain't no other way to do it 
 Whoa 
 Life is good, it's good, it's good 
  
 Uh 
 The craziest things just happened to me, get me 
 So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me 
 How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially 
 If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change 
 And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash 
 So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast 
 I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS 
 Somebody's stealin', I swear to God 
 Tsk, for now, I invest 
 To my incarcerated team who got life 
 It's not right but you still got your life 
 Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks 
 Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops 
 Commercial pop artists get all the accolades 
 I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway 
 Probably not as half as paid as I should be 
 But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy 
 It's a beautiful life 
 Beautiful life, beautiful life 
  
 Whoa 
 Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah) 
 Whoa (Beautiful life) 
 Ups and downs, we've all been through it 
 Whoa (Life's still good) 
 Ain't no other way to do it 
 Whoa (Yeah, yeah) 
 Life is good, it's good, it's good 
  
 A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff 
 I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up 
 Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up 
 Or extorted for my pay stubs 
 Lucky or blessed from what prayer does 
 'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AKs and gloves inside 'em 
 And if I should spare that man who violated my trust 
 I gave him a pass 
 My man called and I value his judgement 
 I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over 
 So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun 
 I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder 
 'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes 
 Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress 
 I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us 
 My younger brother knows this 
 Not Jungle, got another brother in PA 
 Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day 
 I gotta say I got some fam across the USA 
 Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts 
 They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye 
 Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door 
 Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days 
 It wasn't my fault 
 I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York 
 Barely survived 
 Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth 
 How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth 
 Akinyele, you knew 
 I was your brother 'til death 
 Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak 
 You was a dime, we was nobodies 
 Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi 
 I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets 
 We could all still kick it 
 It's a beautiful life 
 Beautiful life, beautiful life 
  
 Rest in peace to my brother Talik 
 Gone too soon 
 God bless your soul brother 
 He was wild 
 Some things we just can't explain 
 Life 
 It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back 
 With your kids at an early age 
 First steps, first words 
 I can't see 'em cause you mad 
 Don't put yourself before the babies 
 Don't say crazy things to hurt that man 
 You hurt him enough 
 The good times outweighed the bad 
 When it was good, it was great 
 But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad 
 Okay that's how it is out here 
 That's life huh 
 You see we can't be selfish out here 
 We gotta live and let love 
 Let the light in 
 To the beautiful mothers of my kids 
 And all the mothers around the world 
 Knight, Destiny 
 Life is good"
"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while 
 Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies 
 Hoping for the best but expecting the worst 
 Are you gonna drop the bomb or not? 
 Let us die young or let us live forever 
 We don't have the power but we never say never 
 Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip 
 The music's for the sad man 
  
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young (young) 
 I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays) 
 Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows) 
 Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinking that far) 
 Forever (ya know what I mean?) 
 Forever young 
  
 So we're living life like a video (video) 
 Where the sun is always out and you never get old 
 And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good 
 And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood 
 And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car 
 Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow 
 Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime 
 And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit ""Rewind"" 
 So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine 
 Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind 
 Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time 
 So when the director yells ""Cut"", I'll be fine 
 I'm forever young 
  
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young) 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young 
  
 Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive 
 Life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky 
 Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye-byes 
 Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive 
 Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots 
 My name shall be passed down to generations 
 While debating up in barbershops 
 Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here 
 With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah) 
 And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears 
 Young'll get younger every year, yeah 
 So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know 
 Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby 
  
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? 
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young 
  
 Just let it run 
 Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches 
 Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up) 
 Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit 
 I be talking more shit, they're nauseous (hold up) 
 I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit 
 And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit 
 Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in 
 Did you get the picture yet? 
 I'm painting you a portrait of Young 
  
 Forever young, I wanna be forever young 
 Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young"

"I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist 
 They call me Slim Roethlisberger 
 I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker 
 A merk her with a Mossberg 
 I'm pissed off get murdered 
 Like someone took a ketchup squirter 
 Squirted a frankfurter 
 For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants 
 When you saw the chainsaw get to waving 
 Like a terrible towel 
 I faced her around 
 But his fangs come out 
 Get your brains blown out 
 That's what I call blowing your mind 
 When I come back 
 Like nut on your spine 
 I'm a thumb tack 
 That you slept on son 
 Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one 
 Low on the totem till he showed 'em 
 Defiance, giant scrotum 
 He don't owe them bitches shit 
 His bridges, he out grow'd em  
 
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Something's gone terribly wrong 
 You're all I wanted 
  
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Can't breath whenever you gone 
 Can't turn back now, I'm haunted 
  
 I'm back for revenge 
 I lost a battle that ain't happening again 
 I'm at your throat like strep 
 I step, strapped with a pen 
 Metaphors wrote on my hand, 
 Someone distorted my mint 
 Read some I wrote on a napkin 
 I do what I have to to win 
 Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's 
 Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers 
 And tell that psycho to pass the torch 
 To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern 
 And smash it on his porch 
 Now get off my dick 
 Dick's too short a word for my dick 
 Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick 
 You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer 
 I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer 
 I displaced my clause with enough plaster 
 To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder 
 You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me 
 See he's in a whole nother weight class 
 He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets 
 You're full of it; you were just in his CD's 
 Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties 
 No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast 
 His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E 
  
 I'm haunted I'm dead your gone 
  
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Something's gone terribly wrong 
 Won't finish what you started 
  
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Can't breath whenever you gone 
 Can't go back, I'm haunted 
  
 Oooooh 
  
 You and I walk a fragile line 
 I have known it all this time 
 Never ever thought I'd see it break. 
 Never thought I'd see it"
"Tech N9ne - Planet (2018) 
  
 This is tribal 
 Stick his rival, in the mouth with a right blow 
 Then he get this pyro 
 Young punk better lie low somewhere pro'ly up in Cairo 
 With a Bible and a psycho 
 Wanna give a hit a light pole 
 When the knife go with the quickness 
 You so full of bitchness 
 You trip flipping on chicks but a b-boy make him wanna shit bricks 
 This is vicious, everything out yo lips is ficticous, hehe 
 Misses made me mad as Mozzy 
 Man the motive must've been made of molly 
 Maximize a mess when I'm running Malcolm X 
 And a martyr man whose mom is Maude 
 Better be cool, I'ma lead you to the B fools that'll greet you 
 With a blacca, blacca, blacca I leave you"
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings 
 But I'm only going to get this one chance 
 (Six minutes, six minutes) 
 Something's wrong, I can feel it 
 (Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on) 
 Just a feeling I've got 
 Like something's about to happen 
 But I don't know what 
 If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble 
 Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say 
 I'm not taking any chances 
 You are just what the doc ordered 
  
 I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God 
 All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod 
 Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? 
 They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot 
  
 But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes 
 I got a laptop in my back pocket 
 My pen'll go off when I half-cock it 
 Got a fat knot from that rap profit 
 Made a living and a killing off it 
 Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office 
 With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack 
 I'm an MC still as honest 
 But as rude and as indecent as all hell 
 Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) 
 This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop 
 You don't really wanna get into a pissing match 
 With this rappity brat 
 Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac 
 Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack 
 And at the exact same time 
 I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that 
 I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table 
 Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half 
 Only realized it was ironic 
 I was signed to Aftermath after the fact 
 How could I not blow? All I do is drop ""F"" bombs 
 Feel my wrath of attack 
 Rappers are having a rough time period 
 Here's a maxi pad 
 It's actually disastrously bad 
 For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah 
  
 'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God 
 All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod 
 Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? 
 Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard 
  
 Everybody want the key and the secret to rap 
 Immortality like I have got 
 Well, to be truthful the blueprint's 
 Simply rage and youthful exuberance 
 Everybody loves to root for a nuisance 
 Hit the Earth like an asteroid 
 Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew) 
 MCs get taken to school with this music 
 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme' 
 Now I lead a new school full of students 
 Me? I'm a product of Rakim 
 Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren 
 Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim 
 Inspired enough to one day grow up 
 Blow up and be in a position 
 To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them 
 Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' 
 Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church 
 And burst in a ball of flames 
 Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame 
 On the wall of shame 
 You fags think it's all a game 
 'Til I walk a flock of flames 
 Off a plank and 
 Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking? 
 Little gay-looking boy 
 So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy 
 You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy 
 Oy vey, that boy's gay 
 That's all they say, looking boy 
 You get a thumbs up, pat on the back 
 And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy 
 Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy? 
 I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy 
 I'mma work for everything I have 
 Never asked nobody for shit 
 Get outta my face, looking boy 
 Basically boy you're never gonna be capable 
 Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause 
  
 I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God 
 All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod 
 The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR 
 Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God 
 Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard 
  
 So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin 
 You're rodent, I'm omnipotent 
 Let off then I'm reloading 
 Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' 
 And I should not be woken 
 I'm the walking dead 
 But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating 
 But I got your mom deep-throating 
 I'm out my Ramen Noodle 
 We have nothing in common, poodle 
 I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself 
 In the arm and pay homage, pupil 
 It's me 
 My honesty's brutal 
 But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize 
 What I do though for good 
 At least once in a while so I wanna make sure 
 Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle 
 Enough rhymes to 
 Maybe try to help get some people through tough times 
 But I gotta keep a few punchlines 
 Just in case 'cause even you unsigned 
 Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime 
 I know there was a time where once I 
 Was king of the underground 
 But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind 
 So I crunch rhymes 
 But sometimes when you combine 
 Appeal with the skin color of mine 
 You get too big and here they come trying to 
 Censor you like that one line I said 
 On ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 
 One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine 
 Put 'em all in a line 
 Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine 
 See if I get away with it now 
 That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm 
 Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal 
 You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though 
 And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for 
 You're pointless as Rapunzel 
 With fucking cornrows 
 You write normal? Fuck being normal 
 And I just bought a new ray gun from the future 
 Just to come and shoot ya 
 Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 
 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag 
 At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man 
 While he played piano 
 Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special 
 On the cable channel 
 So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day 
 ""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"" 
 Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad) 
 Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human 
 What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman 
 Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is 
 Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you 
 I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating 
 How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating 
 Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting 
 For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 
 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated 
 I make elevating music 
 You make elevator music 
 ""Oh, he's too mainstream."" 
 Well, that's what they do 
 When they get jealous, they confuse it 
 ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop."" 
 'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it 
 With rock, shock rap with Doc 
 Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it 
 ""I don't know how to make songs like that 
 I don't know what words to use."" 
 Let me know when it occurs to you 
 While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you 
 It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you 
 How many verses I gotta murder to 
 Prove that if you were half as nice 
 Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to 
 Unghh, school flunky, pill junky 
 But look at the accolades these skills brung me 
 Full of myself, but still hungry 
 I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to 
 And I'm a million leagues above you 
 Ill when I speak in tongues 
 But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you 
 I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel 
 I'm asleep in the front seat 
 Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz 
 Still ""Chunky, but Funky"" 
 But in my head there's something 
 I can feel tugging and struggling 
 Angels fight with devils and 
 Here's what they want from me 
 They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate 
 But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had 
 Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation 
 And understand the discrimination 
 But fuck it 
 Life's handing you lemons 
 Make lemonade then 
 But if I can't batter the women 
 How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? 
 Don't mistake him for Satan 
 It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas 
 And take a vacation to trip a broad 
 And make her fall on her face and 
 Don't be a retard, be a king? 
 Think not 
 Why be a king when you can be a god?"
"Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one 
  
 Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable 
 That the horses come out of-erra 
 Of course we're about to stir up 
 Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup 
 It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason 
 Other than to-just to tease him 
 'Cause he was his biggest  fan 
 He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin' 
 Liquor on the curb in his name for him 
 ""Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker 
 I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."" 
 It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show 
 Ready, get set, let's go 
 Here comes the buckin' bronco 
 Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo 
 Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo 
 Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll 
 Around and around I go 
 When will I stop? I don't know 
 Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off 
 But I know anything's possible 
 Though I'm not gonna top what I sold 
 I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change 
 Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away 
 With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today 
 We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes 
 In a safe, locked 'em away  
 Better watch what you say 
 Just when you thought you were safe 
 Them fuckers got you on tape 
 You swear to God you was playin' 
 Whether or not you was little Joshua 
 Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same 
 'Cause one day it could cost you your name 
  
 And this was supposed to be my first single  
 But I just fucked that up, so 
 Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle  
 Slap a bitch and smack a ho 
 This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle  
 That you hear on your radio 
 But shit's about to hit the shingle  
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra 
 Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra 
 Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah

 Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills 
 And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked 
 Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID 
 To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly 
 Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naÃ¯ve 
 Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree 
 Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish 
 Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks 
 Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry 
 With these words - am I a jerk or just jerk chicken? 
 Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain 
 Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk? 
 Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back 
 And rewind it ...blblblblblblblb... - wait, let me ask you again 
 Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane? 
 Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang 
 Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade 
 Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle 
 Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered 
 Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin' 
 When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club 
 And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em 
 'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni-"" 
 And then tried to erase and record over it 
 But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the 
 ""Ga-hu"" and then they come to 
 Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon-nuh cum!"" 
  
 And this was supposed to be. my first single  
 But I just fucked that up, so 
 Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle  
 Slap a bitch and smack a ho

 Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka 
  
 Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest 
 And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it 
 All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number 
 It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK 
 And if someone picks up 
 You can talk all the shit you want about me 
 Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key 
 And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day 
 That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!) 
 So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken 
 Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock! 
 Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth 
 I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off! 
  
 And this was supposed to be my first single

 So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit 
 (Bitch) I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do 
 Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to 
 They be hipping dudes, how you chickens move, I be listening too 
 (Bitch, bitch, bitch) 
 Don't make me say it thrice, you acting all up tight 
 All sidity like, like you ain't a (Bitch) 
 You ain't no better cause you don't be fucking rappers 
 You only fuck with actors, you still getting fucked backwards 
 (Bitch) Unless you fucked a dude on his own merit 
 And not the way he dribbles or ball or draw lyrics 
 You're a (Bitch), no ma, you're a (Bitch)

 Let's describe a certain female 
 Let's describe a certain female 
  
 Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for, huh? 
  
 (Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve 
 Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves 
 Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up 
 Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up 
 Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids 
 Bitches in street with their nose in your biz 
 Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies 
 Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride 
 Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass 
 Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast 
 Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live 
 Bitches have niggas all up in your crib 
 Sisters tell you quick ""you better check your homie"" 
 Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie 
 Sisters love Jay 'cause they know how Hov' is 
 I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch"
"Yo, yeah 
 It's that (Hit-Boy)

 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It's the N-A-S, yes 
  
 I wake up every morning, thinkin' what we gonna do today? 
 (What we gonna do today?) 
 There's gotta be a better way (Gotta be a better way) 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 To maintain in the... check me out, listen, uh 
  
 Life's a gamble, although the stakes are heightened, I can handle 
 Any darkness that tries to penetrate, my light is ample 
 Set the right example, my dark dreams are divine 
 I live life on this earth to complete what's assigned 
 My mission given, I was birthed the same year as It Was Written 
 I been fast to intermittent to strengthen my intuition 
 But fuck, and sometimes, shit, you run out of luck 
 But how my dice roll from Domino's to Mastro's 
 To completin' life goals? My price rolls 
 As soon as I decided to never ever be misguided 
 I know niggas that's indicted from the shit they confided 
 With they best friends until they seen the paper we're writin' 
 Life's a bitch, disconnection is the price of bliss 
 Though elation often leaves the paths of righteousness 
 I confess, a nigga woke up feeling blessed 
 No stress with the freedom to express but you was dead 
  
 I wake up every morning, thinkin' what I'm bout to do today? 
 (What I'm bout to do today?) 
 There's gotta be a better way-ay 
 To maintain the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 Hey hey hey, life is like a dice game (Yeah, yeah) 
 Hey hey, hey hey hey hey (You know what I'm sayin'?) 
  
 You know what I'm sayin', life is like a... 
 You know what I'm sayin', a dice game 
 But, you know I'm sayin' 
 I, you know I don't gamble, you dig what I'm sayin'? 
 I'd rather spend my money on stuff, you know 
 That-that-that-that pleasures me, my pleasure, you know? 
  
 Nigga we started out, hundred fifty dime bags in mama's house 
 Makin' five hundred a week, thinkin' bout dropping out 
 Sold dope in front of my brother, but he a doctor now 
 Fuck this weed shit, grand show me just what that rock about (Skrrt) 
 Whip gang, I got a thing for cooking crack mane 
 Fuckin' off a double and scribbles, I make it back mane 
 Feds with the IRS on me, they sent the tax mane 
 Streets code, ain't nothing cutthroat like the rap game (The rap game) 
 Do you wanna be in it, wanna be sinnin'? 
 Fuck niggas faÃ§ade wanna be winnin' 
 I said fuck being famous from the beginning 
 Big Rabbit, Instagram wanna ban me for posting pictures 
  
 So I wake up every morning, thinkin' what I'm gonna do today? 
 (Do today?) 
 There's gotta be a better way 
 To keep changing the price of cane, life is like a dice game 
 I wake up, hit the collar, think of getting something new today (Something new today) 
 Paint the Aston Martin blue today 
 These niggas trippin' so I ride with that thing, life is like a dice game 
 I wake up every morning, thinkin' what we gonna do today? 
 (What we gonna do today?) 
 There's gotta be a better way (Gotta be a better way) 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 Yeah 
  
 I never knock a brother, I'm anti-jail for real 
 Smooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield 
 Watchin' niggas get rich beside me 
 Pushin' a 5 B-Y, me up in the passenger seat 
 But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom 
 Sippin' Asti Spumante, driftin', reality kicks in 
 I need the papes to start clickin', got a connect out in Richmond 
 And e'ry nigga in the fam will pitch in 
 It's on, word is bond 
 That's my name, Big Nas, all-wise to civilize 
 From the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth 
 Peace to my son and thanks to the birth of Destiny, that's her name 
 It's goin' on, you know my name 
 Big Nas in the house y'all, on the freestyle tip 
 When I finish this shit, it's sure to be a hit 
 This original recording hit the street 'round '93 
 Was just a leak, the verse was incomplete, reconstructed the beat 
 So we can fuck up the street 
 Back to the future, patch up the bloopers 
 Match up the cadence with the back in the day shit 
 A blast when Nasty Nas was savvier, don't act surprised 
 This ain't for advertise or showing off, I blast for mine 
 Life is a dice roll, there's money on the ground 
 What's gon' happen is gon' happen is a gamble all around 
  
 I wake up every morning, thinkin' what we gonna do today? 
 (What we gonna do today?) 
 There's gotta be a better way 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game (Yeah) 
 To maintain is the price of fame, life is like a dice game 
 Life is like a dice game"
"Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous 
 Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew 
 Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, 'cause she screwed a lot 
 Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots 
 Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature 
 Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her 
 Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her 
 From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur 
 Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty 
 Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840 
 It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me 
 My baby mama beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me 
 But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work 
 I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt 
 She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up 
 She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"" 
 I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do 
 I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"" 
 She said she understood then everything was kosher 
 I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin' poster, it's like that now  
 
 It's like that now 
 You better go on and get the hump up out your back now 
 It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now 
 We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now 
 It's like that now, it's like that now  
 
 Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper 
 I remember her number like the summer 
 When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber 
 Party but you cannot call it that 'cause it was slummer 
 Well it was more like spend the night 
 Three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights 
 We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right 
 In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite 
 All of the bullshit, we on our back staring at the stars above 
 Talking 'bout what we gon' be when we grow up 
 I said, ""What you wanna be?"" she said, ""Alive"" 
 It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes 
 I coulda died, time went on, I got grown 
 Rhyme got strong, mind got blown 
 I came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone 
 Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong 
 I kept on singing my song, and hoping, at a show 
 That I would one day see her standing in the front row 
 But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school 
 With a needle in her arm, baby two months due 
 Sasha Thumper  
 
 It's like that now 
 You better go on and get the hump up out your back now 
 (Uncle Ricky) Yeah 
 It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now 
 Yeah (Can you tell us a story?) 
 We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now 
 (Please?) Oh 
 It's like that now, it's like that now 
 Here we go  
 
 Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch 
 Here we go again with this psychopath bitch 
 The neighbors will hear you, you misfit 
 Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit 
 The price we pay to fuck women 
 The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them 
 Stuck up, as soon as I pop up 
 But see me with the next, she wanna tear the fucking club up 
 Check her pants, a number confirming 
 Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in 
 And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss 
 While she busy trying to justify who cheated first 
 ""Rick what would I want 
 With this small chain wearing muh-fucker trying to front?"" 
 I oughta cut her off, let another soothe me 
 But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me 
 I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bitty 
 But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity 
 So although I know, pretty bitch shady 
 Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady 
 Knahmean?  
 
 It's like that now 
 You better go on and get the hump up out your back now 
 Yeah 
 It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now 
 Yeah 
 We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now 
 Oh 
 It's like that now, it's like that now 
 It's like that now 
 You better go on and get the hump up out your back now 
 Yeah 
 It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now 
 Yeah 
 We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now 
 Oh 
 It's like that now, it's like that now 
 It's like that now 
 You better go on and get the hump up out your back now 
 Yeah 
 It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now 
 Yeah 
 We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now 
 Oh 
 It's like that now, it's like that now"

 Rollies that don't tick-tock 
 Audemars that's losing time 
 Hidden behind all these big rocks 
 (B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too 
 I'm supposed to be locked up too 
 If you escaped what I've escaped 
 You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too 
 (B-ball so hard) Let's get faded

 Gold bottles, scold models 
 Spillin' Ace on my sick J's

 Come and meet me in the bathroom stall 
 And show me why you deserve to have it all""

 Bougie girl, grab my hand 
 Fuck that bitch; she don't wanna dance 
 Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ah ah, I'm just sayin' 
 Prince Williams ain't do it right if you ask me 
 'Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley 
 What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer? 
 What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela? 
 Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness 
 Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

 No one knows what it means, but it's provocative 
 No, it's not, it's gross 
 Gets the people going""

 Don't let me get in my zone 
 Don't let me get in my zone

 You are now watching the throne 
 Don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone

"Turn it up in my head phones, please 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame 
 More, ha ha, comin' to a ghetto near you 
  
 I wasn't mad until these tricks shot me 
 It's time I sanitize my posse 
 Look how paranoid these niggas got me  
 Cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently 
 Mama, chill, thug livin' pay the bills, I'm dyin' violently 
 Closed caskets, expose bastards, I leave 'em bloody 
 Delores Tucker, don't let your kids 
 Hear a nigga speak on gettin' money 
 Ain't nothin' funny, green got a nigga seein' things 
 Why? Hit the lye, hope to God I can fly 
 Lethal weapon, I'm a savage; still a method to my madness 
 Blast niggas, laugh, call 'em care cabbage 
 Read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep, they hell bound 
 Lyrics will leave 'em spell bound 
 Clown, now tired of being held down 
 Cross my heart, hope to die, blind with some pussy 
 Millionaire, livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me 
 Hope in hard times never catch me slippin' 
 Fuck authorities! They wonder why minorities be trippin' 
 We ain't havin' it, time to tear this shit back 
 Ghetto children kick back 
 Once I hit the MAC, niggas'll never get they shit back 
 Spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me 
 Bust until my rounds empty; back for the street fame 
  
 One love to my true thugs 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame 
 Bust! Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame 
 All out warfare, eye for a eye  
 Bustin' on my enemies, bad boy killin' 
 Straight dissin' you 
 Fuck Lil' Kim, you nasty bitch! 
  
 Temperatures rises, niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise 
 No time to plot retreats, niggas shiver and die 
 Multiple rounds found laced in his body and face 
 Wrapped in plastic, the acid erased all traces 
 Criminal tactics, the rap game became so drastic 
 Military mind, mash all the hoes, get blasted 
 If we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror 
 So we strive seein' our lives be reflected in mirrors 
 The prophecy is clear, niggas lock and load, disappear 
 Strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years 
 The crack game wasn't big enough, ready to rush 
 Bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched 
 I go to jail niggas screamin' free me, speakin' freely 
 Conversatin' with my comrades kickin' Swahili 
 Indeed they should fear my first seed 
 It gets worse, planned a curse to be a G, on the first to breathe 
 Currency in stacks, artillery in the back 
 Strapped, armies, we camouflaged in all black 
 When we attack, holla out my set, nigga 
 Tighten your jaw, givin' birth to Outlawz, street fame 
  
 Bust, nigga bust! 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame 
 Only Makaveli the Don 
 Can put it down like this; ain't none like me 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, with street fame 
  
 Positive identification, got me rushed to the station 
 Stuck in this line up, tryin' hard to hide my face 
 They placed the name but can't recall description  
 I ain't did shit, officer, that bitch trippin' 
 Promise retaliation, their plan busted, no man to be trusted 
 Everything corrupted once man touch it 
 Kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me 
 That's why we bye bye daily, knowin' cops trail me 
 But why cry? Floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch 
 Flossin' in the thug stance, pistol tucked inside my pants 
 Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide 
 Sure as hollow-points shatter, enemies die 
 Spread love, dead thugs gettin' buried in riches 
 Take a chance to advance; fuck them worryin' bitches! 
 Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray  
 Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day, hey! 
 Ain't nothin' strange, I'm 25, dyin' to change 
 But still I bang wantin' street fame 
  
 That's the end of that 
 Thugged out, Makaveli the Don  
 Representin' the Outlawz, street fame 
 One love to my true niggas 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you street fame 
 Makaveli the Don, Killuminati 
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame 
  
 Yo, check this out, I'ma tell you like this 
 If the lifestyle that you livin' 
 Got you taking more fuckin' shorts than gettin' props 
 Then that lifestyle need to stop  
 Best to recognize some Outlaw shit  
 'Cause only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to 
 To see what this life's supposed to be like  
 Nigga, you'll start to see riches 
 Fine bitches and hittin' switches 
 Shit, to me that shit sound delicious; street fame"
"Cause it was all meant to happen 
 It was all meant to happen 
 No wonder why you kept walkin' my way 
 Cause it was all meant to happen 
 It was all meant to happen 
 No wonder why you kept walkin'  
 
 My mom was 18, waitin' for her prom date 
 Which was my father, yes, this night's gonna be beyond great 
 Two years prior they both created Aaron Yates 
 So the bond straight with two fine mates, so mom waits 
 And waits, in the upstairs window watchin' 
 For my pops and it was shockin' that he never ever came knockin' 
 Just left her, in her prom dress and that's the eve 
 Where all the stress hit aggressively, she had her first epileptic seizure 
 And kept havin' them, doctor, help the sick lady 
 Medicine with the quickness, just maybe it'll stop 
 'Member this, in '80 I was, nine 
 Asleep and I heard somethin' collapse 
 Hopped up with nothin' but tighty whitie 
 Saw my mom just fell and slapped the floor 
 She shakin', I'm scared, I ran out the house in my underwear 
 ""Help my mama"" is all that's comin' out my mouth 
 A neighbor came to help so mama wouldn't die 
 As a little kid, watchin' the ambulance take her away, I'm thinkin' ""Why?""  
 
  
  
 '92, I was 21 
 Sellin' rocks for my auntie, was plenty fun 
 And yes she loaded the house with many guns 
 She got me a TEC-9 for my birthday, ""No more trippin' from anyone"" 
 Is what I'm thinkin', Boones Farm's what I'm drinkin' 
 Singin' Jodeci loaded, we exploded, these chicks I'm binkin' 
 Daily, nightly, the ladies like me, I'm baby Ikie, 
 Maybe slightly, I'm crazy might be 
 Really shady, sheisty not like this though 
 I'm sleepin' again, this dude breaks in with a pistol 
 I heard his bullet whistle, so I had to roll of on this flo' 
 Heard a struggle then my auntie scream, I'm feelin' for my piece 
 Then, just my luck, my birthday gift that I got wasn't in my reach 
 The gunman busted in my room lookin' for somethin' 
 Found me hidin', pointed the gun right at my head, my heart was pumpin' 
 Then he turned and ran away then with a blink of an eye 
 He was gone, I found my auntie shakin', hidin' in the closet, I'm thinkin' ""Why?""  
 
  
  
 Dear Darkness, you've been with me for so long 
 I never understood, 'til now in this slow song 
 Been in some shaky situations, but life goes on 
 But still, a lot of things you showed this kid was so wrong 
 But what's so right, this pain and strife that I go write 
 People go buy it, they think that my flow's tight 
 Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice 
 Not a low-life anymore it's always sold-out show nights 
 After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you 
 Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through 
 Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you 
 I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true 
 So now I see, these stories in my life 
 I was meant to share my darkness within my light 
 People say it helps them to see me fly 
 From the bottom, that's motivation for them all, now I see exactly why"

 Call me Fifty, call me Ferrari the remedy 
 Hi again in case a hater don't remember me

 I'm writing reality it sounds harsh 
 Shyne (Sean?) try to get at me he sounds washed 
 I ain't even fire back the shits washed 
 What kind of shit is that, this only happens in rap 
 These niggas so fake, it make my skin crawl 
 Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall 
 Ice chunks in the chain, weight spinnin, cream linen 
 Bulges from the Benjamin's in 'em

 And uh, throw up that finger 
 Ayo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?  
 
 Tell me baby are you lonely? 
 Don't wanna rush ya, I can help ya if ya only 
 Let me touch ya, if I'm wrong love tell me 
 'cause I get caught up, and the life I live is Hell see 
 I never thought I'd see, the day when I would calm down 
 You ain't heard, I've been known to clown and Get Around 
 That's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good 
 Yes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me 
 With your attitude to match right? 
 Don't be phony, 'cause I hate when you act like 
 You don't know me I've be stressin' in the spotlight 
 I want the fame, but the industry's a lot like 
 A crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go 
 Can't be with you every minute miss, another show 
 And even though I'm known for my one night stand 
 (Look here) I wanna be an honest man 
 But temptations go  
 
 Throw up the finger! And all my homies go 
 Throw them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like  
 
 I know you've been searchin' for someone 
 To make you happy, and get the job done 
 You say you needed, a man with money 
 But I can't be there, and will you still care  
 
 Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows 
 Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go 
 In my ride and I'm all in 
 Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin' 
 I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin' 
 And to God, gotta keep myself from fall-in 
 But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure 
 What do I do, gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up 
 And say it's cool, should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide 
 If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie 
 Move close and let me whisper 
 Some dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya 
 On every curve, slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow 
 Can't hold it any longer, so let it go 
 Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven 
 And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was  
 
 Give 'em the finger! 
 All my homies go, throw your fingers up 
 That's just the Thug in me girl, you know 
 Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like  
 
 I know you've been searchin' for someone 
 To make you happy, and get the job done 
 You say you needed, a man with money 
 But I can't be there, and will you still care  
 
 A lotta people think it's easy 
 To settle down, got a woman that'll please me 
 In every town, I don't wanna but I gotta do it 
 The temptation got me ready to release the fluid Sensation, sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand 
 'Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand 
 Even the hardest of my homies need attention 
 Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin' 
 I wanna take you to the movies, and the park 
 Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark 
 Now that it's passion, hold me tight 
 Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight 
 I know your man ain't lovin' you right 
 You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life 
 Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin' 
 See you later, 'cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was  
 
 Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go 
 Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know? 
 Throw your fingers up 
 You know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you 
  
 (Everybody, hey, alright 
 Hey, heyyyeah, heyyyayy, oh) 
  
 All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger! 
 Throw your hands up, give em the finger!"
"(Why I go easy?) 
 (Know why I go easy) 
 Wait 
  
 King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland 
 King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again 
 King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin' 
 King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin' 
 King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed 
 King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect 
 King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it 
 King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction 
 King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated 
 King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken 
 King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse 
 King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice 
 King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion 
 Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision 
 I embrace them with collision, kings did it 
 King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king! 
 I dropped a million tears 
 I know several responsibilities put me here 
 I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned 
 The lens that I'm lookin' through 
 Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free 
 Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas 
 Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me 
 Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace 
 But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef 
 What do you stand for? 
 Are you a activist? What are your city plans for? 
 Are you a accident? Are you just in the way? 
 Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say 
 Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'? 
 Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open? 
 Because the king don't cry, king don't die 
 King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall 
 Kingdom come, when I come, you know why 
 (King, king, king, king) 
 I am T'Challa!"
"That was the warm (that was the warm up baby) 
 Aiight, Elite for real. One tape and I'm up out of here 
 One, yup, yea 
 Lord please forgive me for my sinning, I ain't saying that I'm finished but I'm praying in advance 
 Cause they way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants 
 Yea ball game-I swear the hoes wasn't in my plans 
 When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city 
 My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me 
 Like, bobby had Whitney we were cooking up crack! 
 But them 15 credits had a nigga off track 
 Picture that! The best rapper since lil Wayne in classes 
 The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his Bachelors 
 Remasterd this rap shit you hear the words coming from my lips, bastards 
 I never crack, I got that chapstick 
 I practiced til that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter 
 Now wheres the ladder? 
 Cause either you gonna whine or climb, I choosed the ladder 
 Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though 
 Before you get tossed like a forward lateral 
 We never tattle, let God handle that 
 Or let the mob handle that, No soprano 
 Half Black, half white I'm a piano 
 I'm an animal my video on discovery channel 
 I'm a beast when my shit hits the streets these niggas seize to exist 
 Like a beach in a tsunami you'll find me in The Ville in the state of NC 
 Bitch if I ain't back home I'm up in N-Y-C bout that money probably 
 Like a fucking robbery but I ain't Jacking 
 I'm chasing dreams sort of like jeans 
 Boy I ain't slacking, I'm chasing dreams sort of like Jeans boy I ain't slacking 
 Ay take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking on my shit 
 I'm strait smacking niggas strait tagging niggas 
 Yo I'm freestylin fuck ya'll niggas ya'll be wilding and I'm OUT!"

 I destroy him and any motherfucker they lovin' 
 Got my thinking cap on, now I'm sharp as a blade 
 Don't believe me you sit there and watch me get paid 
 New game, homie, my next move is always my best move 
 Stricktigic, I show you motherfucker's my chess move 
 Believe it, I'm not that rapper nigga you used to 
 That hammer hit that shell that hollow tip will go threw you 
 Contact hop, smoke from the cronic got me fellin damonic 
 Shoot one in the head for any nigga that want it 
 I prepare for the worst and wish for the best 
 40 Cali on my hip, teflon on my chest 
 It's toughful math, niggas get blast, D's canning it up 
 Feel the crime scene playin' DA, mad as fuck 
 Hit my voice 'em on the wire tap, now you can get me like that 
 So called investigation, just was time  wasted 
 You call me Palli, call me son, call me don dotta 
 50, I break 'em off proper!

"Buckets like Gilligan 
 Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan 
 Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain 
 Got me revealing men 
 Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again 
 Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles 
 Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round 
 This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown 
 Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown 
 Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down 
 Amphibians, reptiles that make that hiss sound 
 They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down 
 When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round 
  
 I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s 
 Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends 
 Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends 
 B.I.G. shit 
 I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s 
 Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends) 
 The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends) 
  
 Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya 
 Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature 
 When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream 
 ""What does he mean? 
 Who does he think he is? 
 His bank be hid, he hardly out 
 He still as hard as he was when he started out"" 
 We count 'em out, we count 'em in 
 Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt 
 So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends 
 Do they love me for me or love me for them? 
  
 I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s 
 Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends 
 The world's out war, the shit never ends 
 Everybody packin' 
 I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s 
 Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends) 
 It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends) 
 What will it take to end? 
  
 Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest 
 I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses 
 They hate it before they hear it 
 Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear 
 It's become apparently clear 
 They fear me, I'm not dying or rather 
 Put my ears to the blaring cop siren 
 Am I here or in a hot dryer? 
 Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin' 
 Niggas should stop lyin' 
 Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying 
 To change, but you not risin'? 
 When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in' 
 Cars, you just started drivin' 
 I've been ridin', been made it 
 You and your pretend stages 
 I did this since windbreakers (Windbreakers)"
"Troublesome, nigga 
 Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfucking-96 
 (Westside!) Let it be known, nigga! 
 Boss of all bosses, Makaveli 
  
 Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon 
 Making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections 
 Can you picture my specific plan? 
 To be the man in this wicked land 
 Underhanded hits are planned 
 These Scams are plotted over grams and rocks 
 Outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots 
 We all die in the end, so revenge we swore 
 I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes! 
 Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater 
 Got me a dog and named her my ""bitch nigga eater"" 
 What could they do to me, you lil' brat? 
 Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass 
 How can I show you how I feel inside? 
 We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride 
 Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone 
 'Cause they fear me in my physical form 
 Let it be known I'm troublesome 
  
 La la la la, la, la 
 La, la-la la, lahhh 
 Bye bye, bye bye 
 All you niggas die  
 
 Troublesome nigga, Outlawz 
 Put it down to the fullest 
 Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha 
 We troublesome 
 Y'all know what time it is 
 Call the punk police, they can't stop us 
 Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit 
  
 Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto 
 We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels 
 Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first 
 Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse 
 Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely 
 Screaming, ""Fuck all ya'll niggas!"" in Swahili 
 Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back 
 Release me to the care of my heartless strap 
 Say my name three times like Candyman 
 Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche 
 A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's 
 Murder my foes, can't control my 9 
 Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please 
 Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee 
 Picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass 
 When I dumped he died, 'cause I'm troublesome 
  
 La la la la, la, la 
 La, la-la la, lahhh 
 Bye bye, bye bye 
 All you niggas die  
 
 Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck - I'm hopeless 
 I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby 
 I'm troublesome, haha 
 Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer 
 What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw - Outlaw! 
  
 ""Murder murder"" my mind state, shit ain't changed 
 Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline 
 Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind 
 Like 25 to life never crossed they mind 
 Tell me young nigga never learned a thang 
 Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang 
 Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry 
 Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die"" 
 Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream 
 Afraid to sleep; I'm having crazy dreams 
 Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times 
 God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but I plan to die 
 Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G. 
 Did the best I could, raised in insanity 
 Or send me to Hell, 'cause I ain't begging for my life 
 Ain't nothing worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life 
 I'm troublesome 
  
 La la la la, la, la 
 La, la-la la, lahhh 
 Bye bye, bye bye 
 All you niggas die 
  
 In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me 
 Hahahaha - I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck 
 I'm troublesome... like my nigga Napoleon said, nigga 
 Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit 
 Ha ha, I'm troublesome 
 You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique 
 Young rugged and sick 
 Makaveli the Don, the Boss of all Bosses 
 Mussolini, E.D.I. Amin, Hussein Fatal 
 Kadafi, Kastro, Napoleon, Po-Nitty 
 Haha, we ain't fuckin' around 
 Haha, we Troublesome 
 Ayo, haha, we Troublesome, I ain't going, HA HAH 
 Young Kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash 
 Going for the hoes and the cash 
 Fuck you niggas! Outlawz! Ha hah! 
 Khadafi - trump tight, never sloppy 
 Them motherfuckers try to copy 
 But they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong 
 Outlawz keep it going on, you know whassup 
 Outlawz, Outlawz, all you niggas die 
 Outlawz, Outlawz 
 This is dedicated to the real niggas 
 All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets 
  
 ...bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas die"

"Young mothers (that's right) 
 I feel ya (hey)  
 I know how it is  
 Mama's just a little girl (just a little girl) 
 Don't nobody understand  
 I feel ya   
 
 She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls 
 A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world 
 Though she could never understand why  
 Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die 
 Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still 
 See her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed 
 Little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died 
 You can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky 
 Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin' 
 It's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant 
 No money, no home, and even though you're all alone 
 You gots to do this on your own, so baby gone 
 I wish you luck and if you need me, call 
 Just come to me and let me feed you all  
 I can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world 
 Facin' all this drama when Mama's just a little girl  
 
 Mama don't know why 
 Mama's just a little girl  
 Livin' if she is or not 
 Time ain't on her side  
 Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl) 
 She gotta hold her head up high   
 
 At sixteen 
 What a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen 
 And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?!) 
 She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey) 
 Got violated by someone she dated  
 If this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited 
 Though it takes time to build a body and a mind 
 She reclines nine months then finally it's time 
 What do we find? Little growin' boy of mine 
 With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime 
 Had no time for the growin' stage 
 He learned his values on the streets at an early age  
 Watch for police, don't come home (why?) 
 Cuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al 
 'Bout to have another baby  
 Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within 
 Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men? 
 So we began, closest family, such insanity 
 A happy home, from one act of inhumanity 
 Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted 
 Used to rub Her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us 
 Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps 
 Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)  
 How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world? 
 She ain't the cause of all the drama  
 Cause Mama's just a little girl  
 
 Mama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know) 
 Mama's just a little girl  
 Livin' if she is or not 
 Time ain't on her side  
 Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl) 
 She gotta hold her head up high  
 (How could she raise us)   
 
 Now, will she remain in the same spot? 
 The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot 
 Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt 
 Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt 
 Fulfilled prophecy 
 But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me 
 I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse 
 What could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth 
 Only functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in 
 Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin 
 I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted 
 I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it 
 Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried 
 Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery 
 Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares 
 No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share 
 In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans 
 Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand 
 Mama told me not to be a punk 
 Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey) 
 There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world 
 Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl (Heyheyy) 
 Hell naw, (that's right) see mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)  
 
 Mama don't know why 
 Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl) 
 Livin' if she is or not 
 (y'all ain't facin' all this drama cause mama just a little girl) 
 Time ain't on her side 
 Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl) 
 She gotta hold her head up high   
 
 They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do  
 And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life (Facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl) 
 To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came (Mama's just a little girl) 
 You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had 
 Damaged petals 
 On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity 
 We would all love its will to reach the sun  
 Well, we are the roses (we are the roses) 
 This is the concrete (this is the concrete) 
 And these are my damaged petals (these are my damaged petals) 
 Don't ask me why (don't ask why) 
 Thank God, nigga (thank god) 
 Ask me how (Ahahaha) 
 You see, mama's just a little girl 
 Mama (hey)... 
 Mama"
"Yeah sometimes 
 I feel like 
 (Feeling like I lost my mind) 
 Always close 
 But I never been to you 
 And then the next moment 
 It's like I'm running from you 
 And I'm sorry 
 My hearts supposed to be 
 But sometimes that's all I have 
 Forgive me 
 I feel lost in my mind 
 Yes, another pain in my head 
 I feel so broken inside 
 With memories I'm trying to forget 
 I don't feel like I used to 
 Matter of fact not even close 
 I don't feel right 
 Yet I choose to 
 To go to a place I don't know 
 Maybe I'm crazy 
 Maybe I'm not 
 I feel like I'm out of control 
 And God I need you 
 Right now 
 I never should've let you go 
 Now I'm just so out of control  
 
 And now I don't know who I am 
 This was never my plan 
 This is the way I was supposed to be 
 I took it out of your hands 
 I took a chance 
 But how am it supposed to see 
 When I'm blinded 
 When I'm broken 
 Looking for a way to escape 
 I can't find it 
 But then I'm reminded of your grace 
 Of your grace  
 
 I thought I was fine 
 I guess not 
 If I was I wouldn't feel this way 
 If I was okay 
 And I was so perfect 
 Then why do I feel so ashamed 
 And I'm no liar in my head 
 Screaming I don't need any help 
 I say I'm trying yet in the air 
 I'm only telling lies to myself 
 I say I want answers 
 Complaining 
 I'm just looking for truth 
 And yes I got problems 
 Which I got 'em 
 I seem like I blame on you 
 It's like I don't know what to do  
 
 And now I don't know who I am 
 This was never my plan 
 This is the way it was supposed to be 
 I took it out of your hands 
 I took a chance 
 But how am I supposed to see 
 When I'm blinded 
 When I'm broken 
 Looking for a way to escape 
 I can't find it 
 But then I'm reminded of your grace 
 Of your grace  
 
 Lord forgive me 
 I feel so cold 
 Living in the wrong 
 Yeah here I go 
 I don't want to cry 
 I don't want to show all the emotion 
 I got froze 
 I don't know how say this 
 Easy 
 But can I can I man me 
 I don't see me 
 I don't see the things I used to know 
 Swore to myself 
 Never let you go 
 Here I go 
 Pain again 
 Here I go 
 Plan retain 
 Acting like I'm fine 
 When in my mind I'm just breaking 
 Looking for a reason 
 Wonder why I'm breathing 
 Why did my momma had to die 
 Lord Jesus 
 I don't understand this 
 I ain't never planned it 
 My plan did never involved 
 We feeling trashed it 
 I feel like I keep falling down 
 Lord please help me up 
 I've had enough  
 
 And now I don't know who I am 
 This was never my plan 
 This is the way it was supposed to be 
 I took it out of your hands 
 I took a chance 
 But how am I supposed to see 
 When I'm blinded 
 When I'm broken 
 Looking for a way to escape 
 I can't find it 
 But then I'm reminded of your grace 
 Of your grace"
"Hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga 
 Can't you read the signs? 
  
 Mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck 
 Can you picture a middle finger out the window 
 Gettin' fucked of liquor; get loaded, can't control it 
 Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it 
 You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black 
 So be a mack and keep your dough fat 
 And tell me, what does it take to be a G? 
 I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki' 
 You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert 
 Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt 
 And now I'm in the rap game 
 Like the crack game, I got enemies 
 Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies 
 And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun 
 Stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum 
 What does it take to be a G? 
 Silence is a must, violence is a plus 
 Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry 
 Pick a spot to be buried 
 'Cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry 
  
 Thug for life, high 'til I die 
 When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em 
 Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry 
 Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary 
 Raise hell, when them niggas mention me 
  
 Thug for life, high 'til I die 
 When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em  
 
 Game thicker than most of these tricks 
 I got my mind on makin' money 
 But you stuck on these fake bitches 
 And jealous motherfuckers can't see 
 That's it's the fame that causes 
 These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free 
 So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me? 
 A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's 
 You pussy-ass playa hating hoes 
 Freaking down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows 
 And you the first motherfucker to jump 
 To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk 
 Thug motherfuckers don't die 
 We get high and we multiply, motherfucker 
 Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay 
 I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK 
  
 Thug for life, high 'til I die 
 When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em 
 Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry 
 Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary 
 Raise hell, when them niggas mention me 
  
 Thug for life, beyatch! Yeah, nigga 
 Thug Life, from now until for motherfuckin' forever 
 Have-nots in this, motherfucker"
"I got myself a gun 
 Brooklyn, stand up 
 I got myself a gun 
 But really, I don't need the heat 
 Ya heart pump project Kool-Aid you sweet (nigga) 
 I ain't gotta two-way you gays 
 This is not beef 
 This is rap homie 
 I don't have a scratch on me 
 You feel Jay soft 
 Rip Jay off 
 Damn I'm only worth over a hundred million 
 Look 
 I got beef with like a hundred children 
 Niggas with pink suits 
 Trying to get cute 
 You a little outta line homie 
 Don't let the 9 homie 
 Put ya out ya mind homie 
 Just rhyme homie 
 Kick yo little lies 
 I kick my real facts 
 Like you sneaking out the back 
 At the Source Soundlab (uh) 
 We wasn't chasing you 
 We had a tape and too 
 We came through to do our little one, two thing 
 It wasn't a Roc-a-Fella come through thing 
 If it was on like that (nigga) 
 Why would I come through Queens 
 Y'all Queens niggas know how I do 
 I got mo' shooters in Queens Bridge than you 
 Niggas'll tie you up on the Colosseum roof 
 And open beer bottles off ya boy's chipped tooth 
 Look here 
  
 I got myself a gun, uh oh! 
 Yea, I got myself a gun 
  
 Listen 
 I'm the J, the A, to the fuck this broad 
 This nigga never sold aspirin 
 How you Escobar? 
 Had to buy you're chain back the last time you got robbed 
 The nerve of this coward nigga (oh my God) 
 And all rap rumors are innuendo 
 I bring them to you live 
 Lift up ya window 
 Let the public begin to see your dirty laundry 
 Ya'll don't want me to continue (Hova) 
 Super ugly, nigga 
  
 I don't give a fuck 
  
 All I really know is that yo hoe wants to be with me 
 She ain't playing 
 Believe what I'm saying 
  
 Me and the boy A.I. got more in common than just balling and rhyming 
 Get it? More in Carmen 
 I came in ya Bentley backseat 
 Skeeted in Jeep 
 Left condoms on ya baby seat 
 Here nigga, the gloves is off 
 The love is done 
 It's whatever, whenever, however, nigga (one) 
 And since you infatuated with saying that gay shit 
 yes you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch 
 Nasty shit 
 You thought I was boning Ranette 
 You calling Carm' a hundred times I was boning her neck 
 You got a baby by that broad 
 You can't disown her yet 
 When does ya lies end? 
 When does the truth begin? 
 When does reality set it? 
 Or does it not matter 
 Gotta hurt that I'm ya baby mama's favorite rapper 
 And ask your current girl 
 She know what's up 
 Holler at a real nigga, Jigga 
  
 I don't give a fuck"

 I thought I had it all figured out, I did 
 I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim 
 But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once 
 I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs 
 Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave 
 How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me 
 Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt 
 Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me 
 The minute shit was heated she just bailed 
 I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself 
 I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell 
 Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt 
 Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground 
 I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail 
 I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female 
 I need to slow down 
 Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm

 Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look 
 At nothin', this world's too much 
 I've swallowed all I could 
 If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good 
 Just say goodbye to Hollywood 
 I probably should, these problems are piling all at once 
 'Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up 
 I think I'm bottomin' out 
 But I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up 
 Thank God, I got a little girl 
 And I'm a responsible father 
 So not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud 
 Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how I do it 
 All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps of my dad 
 'Cause I hate him so bad 
 The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man 
 If you could understand why I am the way that I am 
 What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em I'm

 I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it 
 For me to have this much appeal like this is sick 
 This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick 
 Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick 
 Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats 
 If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass 
 I love my fans 
 But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have 
 I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is whack 
 This is more than I ever could of asked 
 Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask 
 What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that 
 It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped 
 If I could go back, I never woulda rapped 
 I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back 
 I just wanna leave this game with level head intact 
 Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein' 
 Everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing 
 It's fuckin' crazy 
 'Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had 
 But instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

"Whoa, a-get your hands in the air 
 And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth 
 Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't 
 It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen 
 I be the F-R-O, the double G 
 And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er 
  
 Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady 
 I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady 
 I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer 
 Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer 
 You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from 
 You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album 
 Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open 
 I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then 
 My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall) 
 I have a disease and they don't know what to call it 
 Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash 
 Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass 
 Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make your eyes spin 
 You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh) 
 The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton 
 I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman 
  
 So when you see me on your block with two Glocks 
 Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck) 
 Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin' 
 Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)

 My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck) 
 But see me on the street and duck 
 'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed 
 ('Cause I just don't give a fuck) 
  
 I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone 
 I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone 
 I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason 
 I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin' 
 Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview 
 I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review 
 I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals 
 This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols 
 But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles 
 Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye) 
 Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion 
 Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion 
 The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic 
 Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict 
 Half animal, half man 
 Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can 
 With more holes than an afghan

 Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out) 
 I'm a caged demon 
 On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine 
 I'm convinced I'm a fiend 
 Shootin' up while this record is spinnin' 
 Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion 
 Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure 
 I'll bite your motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher 
 I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches 
 Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes 
 In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush 
 Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush 
 Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed 
 Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team 
 Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian 
 Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again 
 I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median 
 Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

"Aw, yeah, I get around 
 Still clown with the Underground 
 When we come around 
 Stronger than ever  
 
 Back to get wreck, all respect 
 To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check 
 'Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly 
 And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me 
 She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me 
 And every time she sees me 
 She squeeze me-lady, take it easy! 
 Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me 
 I don't want it if it's that easy 
 Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem, saying ""bye-bye"" 
 Just another hazard of a fly guy 
 You ask ""Why?"", don't matter! My pockets got fatter 
 Now everybody's lookin' for the latter 
 And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me 
 Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me 
 And I'll be there in a jiffy 
 Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie 
 But when you learn you can't tie me down 
 Baby doll, check it out: I get around 
  
 What you mean you don't know? I get around 
 The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around 
 Still down with the Underground, I get around 
 Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know!  
 
 Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich 
 So cease and desist with them tricks 
 I'm just another black man caught up in the mix 
 Tryin' to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel) 
 Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets 
 Baby, I can see that you don't recognize me 
 I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties 
 Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around  
 
 What's up, love? How you doin'? 
 Well, I've been hangin', sangin', tryin' to do my thang 
 Oh, you heard that I was bangin' 
 Your homegirl you went to school with? 
 That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister? 
 And your cousin thought I wasn't 
 See, weekends were made for Michelob 
 But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo 
 And don't mistake my statement for a clown 
 We can keep in the down low 
 Long as you know that I get around 
  
 What you mean you don't know? I get around 
 The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around 
 Still down with the Underground, I get around 
 Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know!  
 
 Finger tips on the hips as I dip 
 Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships 
 It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin' 
 Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watchin' 
 Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn 
 Now we're all alone: why the lights on? 
 Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft 
 Somethin' is on your mind, let it off 
 You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me 
 Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me? 
 It's a lot of real G's doin' time 
 'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie 
 You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly 
 You need to hit the door, search for a new guy 
 'Cause I only got one night in town 
 Break out or be clowned, baby doll, are you down? I get around"
"I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that? 
 Alright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever 
 I try not to obey them at any time 
 That's what I believe in, not believing in 
 (So what keeps you alive?) 
 Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and 
 Uh, I don't-what keeps me alive? Shit, um 
 Music, I have to listen to music all day long 
 I'd say that keeps me going 
 I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times 
 And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing 
 {Thank you}  
 
 Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go 
 Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever 
 It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts 
 And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect 
 I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses 
 You should either hear me now or go deaf 
 Or end up dead, die trying and know death 
 Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath 
 Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga 
 I mean that from the bottom of my heart 
 You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet 
 Even when the enemy can throw salt 
 Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car 
 Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from 
 We buy guns and more guns to give to the young 
 I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga 
 Inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas 
 My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight 
 He told me, ""Rap about life, not rap, niggas."" 
 That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissing 
 My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching 
 I start evaluating, then my final intuition 
 Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up 
 We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse 
 Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre 
 And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph 
 Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance 
 Put burners in the hands of the black man 
 One hood with twenty four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant 
 You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am 
 You probably even listened to ""Faith"" and think I know Zion 
 But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth 
 Because it seem like it's always clashing with science 
 I got a big fear of flying 
 My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying 
 I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick 
 The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance 
 You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness 
 You just mind your business 
 You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennis 
 It's kinda scary, ain't it? 
 You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous 
 Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless? 
 'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hated it 
 So much, you probably had your burner tucked at graduation 
 Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing 
 Twenty-five to life with a murder charge 
 Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God 
 I pray these bars get farther than Compton 
 And if our record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest 
 Secret society, all we ask is trust 
 And all we lack is communication like service sucks 
 The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come 
 And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month 
 Alright?"" Gotta keep it pushing 
 Can't let the government tell me how my future looking 
 I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookings 
 If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender 
 I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta 
 In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter 
 How splendid, I guess my project had did it 
 Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different 
 They said seven tracks, I said fifteen 
 Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping 
 But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules 
 That we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions 
 Uppity bitches, handling business 
 Killing our dreams, stealing our vision 
 Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home 
 In L.A. everybody think they're fucking on 
 Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit 
 Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone 
 I swear to God, most of y'all cats just don't know Kendrick 
 You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended 
 Ain't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my mamma them Benzes 
 Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time, ambitions 
 Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living 
 Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to master mine 
 Just to match the grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the  
 
 We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP for this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D 
 Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated"

"This is a public service announcement 
 Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records 
  
 Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation 
  
 Allow me to re-introduce myself 
 My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V 
 I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z 
 I guess even back then you can call me 
 CEO of the R-O-C, Hov! 
 Fresh out the frying pan into the fire 
 I be the music biz number one supplier 
 Flier than a piece of paper bearing my name 
 Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, that's right 
 Hov, OH-not D.O.C 
 But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better"" 
 I check cheddar like a food inspector 
 My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast"" 
 So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude 
 With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace 
 Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this 
 I shoot at you actors like movie directors 
 This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit) 
  
 Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE! 
 And I don't care WHAT you think about me-but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you Jack! 
  
 Ving ain't lie 
 I done came through the block in everything that's fly 
 I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex 
 I never claimed to have wings on 
 Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought 
 Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm 
 You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game 
 I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change 
 And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me 
 Lying as if I am a different man 
 And I could blame my environment but 
 There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains 
 Hope you don't think users are the only abusers 
 Niggas getting high within the game 
 If you do then, how would you explain? 
 I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins 
 I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period 
 Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it 
 Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer 
 No matter where you go, you are what you are player 
 And you can try to change but that's just the top layer 
 Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here 
 Only God can judge me, so I'm gone 
 Either love me, or leave me alone

 We gotta get the get well cards, niggas is sick

 Motion picture shit, ha ha 
  
 Now don't think I won't hit you 'cause I'm popular 
 I got a P-90 Reuger to pop at you 
 Catch ya slippin' I'mma give you what I got for ya 
 My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya 
 Never had a hot gun on your waist and blood on your shoe 
 'Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you? 
 Homie you ain't been through what I been through 
 You not like me and I'm not like you 
 I'm like a animal with it when I spit it it's crazy 
 Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryna play me 
 One shot is not enough you need least an Uzi to move me 
 After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy 
 I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies 
 I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me 
 I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked 
 I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you 
 Spray shells through your convertible 
 Lotus, you notice? 
 Rich or poor hollows still go through your door, this is war 
 You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back

 Yeah I know you like that 
  
 Green Lantern 
 Shady Records 
 Anger Management Tour, homie

"It's so beautiful in here 
 Outside now is a no-go 
 Why though? 
 Dark in the days so the gray gon' show 
 Okay? 
 Everyone seems contagious 
 Death toll stays outrageous 
 So in my brain every day is Las Vegas 
  
 Inside I- 
 I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying 
 I got sunshine and cherry wine 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 Every time, yes 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 I found myself a pick-me-up 
 Don't get stuck 'cause this life is fucked up 
  
 Health stores closed but not the golden arches 
 Purchase a gun at Walmart and they see an open Target 
 If you're a certain shade 
 Your working days it'll be curtains paid for the person's played jerk and sprayed 
 See the cursed in graves 
 It's really shockin', how quick we fill these coffins 
 St. Louis still the top peally spot where we kill we often 
 Learnin' that the Bane days they sent the silly cops in 
 We turn into back to the same page like we milly rockin' (what?) 
 Outsiders without pride 
 Beef with nothing but some stout guys and about die 
 In my head I never mouth lies, I shout whys 
 Come outside, it's fam without lies on the southside 
 Wasn't many we vote for 
 Cause with grim mean these po-po 
 I'm Public Enemy's logo 
 Rubbage been with me so yo 
 This fucking energy grow though 
 So I duck within and below low 
 Really nothing limits me (oh no) 
  
 Inside I- 
 I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying 
 I got sunshine and cherry wine 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 Every time, yeah 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 I found myself a pick-me-up 
 Don't get stuck 'cause this life is fucked up 
  
 I am not oblivious though! 
 Even though I live in my head, the Killer City is so 
 Over men crazy, cause we can get in the busiest bro 
 Pity is all I send 'em where the idiots go 
 My bad, I'm back 
 In the inside, no sin rides 
 Nothing but the zin fly 
 Come out and the ones who wouldn't run and hide 
 Been died 
 Evil men tried them bin lies 
 The devil in stride, your grave will been wide and inscribe 
 Damn 
 Total chaos, I'm guessing it's strife 
 And an evil person flexing his rights 
 They just want Tech and his mic 
 But if we get in a fight, complexion is right 
 All he gotta say is that I threatened his life 
 I'm laughing in my head 
 But I see the demon staring at Aaron 
 But it ain't no sparing the chair 
 When they think I'm glaring at Karen 
 Another sucker they love to cut ya 
 And call you an accuser of the brethren 
 You fucking motherfucker! 
  
 Inside I- 
 I'm running and swimming and laughing and flying 
 I got sunshine and cherry wine, yes 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 Every time, yeah 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 I found myself a pick-me-up 
 Don't get stuck 'cause this life is fucked up 
  
 Running and swimming and laughing and flying 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind 
 Floating in the ocean of my mind"

 On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance 
 Pass hash from left to right 
 Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight 
 Met a bitch at the Versace store

 Bust on bitches belly, rub it in their tummy 
 Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man

"2001 we did a lot of touring. 2002 we went on the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour with Jay-Z, 3-11, Talib, N.E.R.D., Hoobastank and more. That tour started us even more Technicians that were into more like rock, metal and even more mainstream fans. Then we got voted to go on the Wicked Wonka Tour with I.C.P., Bone Thugs, and K.M.K., by I.C.P.'s fans called Juggalos in 2003. But Juggalos were a hard crowd to crack because we were newcomers to their world. So when we did that first week on that tour, we would hit the stage, and the first three rows of people would have they backs turned to us. We never experienced anything like that, so we was like, ""what the fuck?"" 'Til our first song hit like, ""Stamina, I be damned if I ever be,"" and we watched slowly, night after night, everybody in those rows started turning around, you know what I'm saying, and partying with us. So after we got them on board, were all the other Technicians. We've been converting fans ever since no matter what they genre. And our goal since day one has been world domination. It's happening

"Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love with 'em 
 Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business 
 What is this with you, all you wanna do is lay around 
 And stay around and get mad when I play around 
 Tuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get with me 
 Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say 
 So I guess you think I'm slippin' 'cause I ain't flippin' 
 Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin' 
  
 I don't care about the money or the cars that you got uh 
 'Cause it don't mean nothing 
 I done did a whole lot and I got my own 
 I can teach you some thing 
 I'm not impressed by those things 
 'Cause I ain't the one who needs you 
 The reason that I fuck with you ain't because I need you baby 
 I do what I wanna do, I don't need a man to save me 
 If it's money in the bank, I got it 
 You don't never have to do without it with me 
  
 All I do all day is drink Tanqueray 
 Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face 
 It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme 
 I hear you jump in every car, except for mine 
  
 But you mean them Benzes and Bentleys they see me in all the time? 
 The range rover trucks? That's all mine 
  
 You better slow your roll baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me 
 You know the pin number, just page me when you real baby

 So let me hold you down 
 You could do the same for me 
 Baby you're so bright on top 
 I could be your everything 
 Just don't take me for granted 
 Like someone else couldn't have it 
 There's so many fish in the sea (so many fish in the sea) 
  
 The reason that I fuck with you ain't because I need you baby 
 I do what I wanna do, I don't need a man to save me 
 If it's money in the bank, I got it

 Alright, on three, one, two, three 
 Get all folks together, walk this way 
 Can't believe it though 
 The homeboy, hey, open that door 
 Open it, alright 'right 
  
 We've come together by God's demand 
 Whether it be for life or death 
 Well, this morning, it's over the mourning 
 Of one of our little brothers 
  
 This brother was a good brother 
 He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble 
 But it's one thing, it's one thing, it's one thing... 
 He was the wrong nigga to fuck with!"
"Fight the pain, inside the rain 
 A rebel know, to let the devil go 
 So now to get paid, about to be working like a slave  
 
 I'm kinda good, kinda bad, kinda get money can't be mad 
 I'm kinda broke but I'm kinda rich 
 Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in 
 They ain't gonna do nothing 
 Ain't like I'm suffering 
 Food for my baby's mouth 
 Then I bought a house for my baby mother and 
 What's wrong? I try, don't matter, still die 
 I'm strong, but I'm not 
 When I'm alone, I cry 
 Out for you, it's hard to do 
 I can't see you so doubt for you 
 When out my mouth I sprout the noose 
 Too much vodka and mountain dew 
 Explainin' what I be meanin' 
 If you listen fast you think I was a Heathen 
 But the last Sunday receivin' the preacher from the pastor 
 Ain't even believin' the bastard 
 But no Hades, god's baby 
 God made me, a little crazy 
 And I'm off, I'm gone 
 My life is my songs 
 What I mean when I sing, still on a wing and a prayer 
 But if I listen to what is written in the scriptures maybe it will get me there 
 Share with the people I swear it is an evil scam that might be in vain 
 But if I say I I'm the genius then like jesus everybody gonna know my name 
 (KALI)  
 
 I've been working like a slave oh, lord 
 And I get tired along this lonesome journey 
 I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong 
 I know, I know that there's no peace in my shelter 
 There's going to be no peace in my shelter  
 
  
 I need reparations due to devastation from the state of present situations 
 And it's not easy to walk a narrow path in my jeans 
 It's hard when your family wondering when your going to make another 
 Stop leaving, stop breathing for a minute cuz it's all artificial when the laws trying to get you 
 When them haters right behind em and you wanna shove a double barrel sawed off in your dental 
 What can I do to stop a big catastrophe 
 When niggas after me and bitches after me 
 Wanna have my baby, listen niggas lady 
 Trials and tribulations tackle me 
 My mama think I made it, she feeling elated 
 Proud of her only son born 
 My kids think I'm the greatest 
 I cannot display this 
 Smile feelin like a funyon 
 (Salty and all) you'll be (locked in a stall) trying (lost in the cause) truly, no denying 
 Ain't nobody gonna do it for me 
 For the moment let it drive me insane 
 Solicitation of a prostitute 
 Cuz you a ho when you're playing this game 
 But it's okay, I am gonna to ride till I triumph 
 Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave 
 This is Callhoun  
 
 I've been working like a slave oh, lord 
 And I get tired along this lonesome journey 
 I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong, I know 
 I know there's no peace in my shelter  
 
 I work, I play, and I drink booze every day 
 tryin to muffle the blues 
 Imma say used in a way 
 Fools run astray 
 Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me 
 Mama got a problem with diabetes it don't seem healthy 
 Everything depends on ninna fame hittin dantez sr 
 Got a nigga thinkin some of the fans I'm makin would they wanna do me like Selina 
 Devil laughin like a hijena 
 Losin all the good in my demeanor 
 I don't wanna go psycho 
 But choke the flow you know I got ta go and charlie sheen yaa 
 Tryina stay good with the old lady 
 My mind made it go crazy no time for my poor babies 
 So don't let a motherfucker play me 
 When I say FU pay me 
 Even though I'm gettin' money you could still see I'm hungry like I'm in Haiti 
 What am I to do? What am I to you? 
 Bought alot of coo, but im not immune 
 Can't you see? I'm stressed not free 
 From yall. I'm sick. My body's hot 
 If in this (pressure) don't let up this will probably stop for 
 Technina..

 With no intentions of returning tomorrow

 Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder 
 Right into the clip, bring it to the floor

 No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys 
 What else could I possibly do to make noise? 
 I done touched on everything but little boys 
 That's not a stab at Michael 
 That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho 
 I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
 I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
 Good God, dip, do a little slide 
 Bend down, touch your toes and just glide 
 Up the center of the dance floor

 And it's cool if you let one go 
 Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it? 
 Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK!

 Well, it's Friday and it's my day 
 Just to party all the way to Sunday 
 Maybe 'til Monday, I dunno what day 
 Everyday's just a holiday 
 Crusin' on the freeway 
 Feelin' kinda breezy 
 Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow 
 I dunno where I'm goin' 
 All I know is when I get there 
 Someone's gonna touch my body 
  
 Excuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
 But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
 Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair? 
 Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah) 
 Now, what's your name, girl? 
 What's your sign? 
  ""Man, you must be up out your mind."" 
 DRE! (AH-AH) 
 Beer goggles! Blind! 
 I'm just tryna unwind now I'm 
  
 Now I'm gonna make you dance 
 It's your chance 
 Yeah, boy, shake that ass 
 Oops, I mean girl, 
 Girl, girl, girl, 
 Girl, you know you're my world 
 Alright now lose it 
 (AH-AH-AH-AH-AH) 
 Just lose it 
 (AH-AH-AH-AH-AH) 
 Go crazy 
 (AH-AH-AH-AH-AH) 
 Oh, baby 
 (AH-AH) 
 Oh, baby, baby 
 (AH-AH) 
  
 It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
 I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
 They say I was running butt-naked 
 Down the street screaming 
 (AH-AH-AH-AH-AH) 
 Well, I'm sorry, I don't remember 
 All I know is this much 
 I'm not guilty 
 They said, ""Save it, boy, we gotcha you on tape yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch My Body!'"" 
  
 Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
 It gets real intense, no one makes a sound 
 Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
 The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
 Snap back to reality 
 Look it's B.Rabbit! 
 Yo you signed me up to battle!? 
 I'm a grown man! 
 Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie 
 I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie! 
 Fella's (what?!) fella's (what?!) 
 Grab you left nut, make your right one jealous (what?) 
 Black girls 
 White girls 
 Skinny girls 
 Fat girls 
 Tall girls 
 Small girls 
 I'm callin' all girls 
  
 Everyone report to the dance floor 
 It's your chance for a little romance or 
 Butt squeezin' it's the season 
 Just go (AH-AH-AH-AH) 
 It's so appeasin' 
  
 Now I'm gonna make you dance 
 It's your chance 
 Yeah, boy, shake that ass 
 Oops, I mean girl, 
 Girl, girl, girl, 
 Girl, you know you're my world 
 Alright now lose it

 Go crazy

 Oh, baby

 Oh, baby, baby 
 (AH-AH) 
  
 UmMmMmm touch my body 
 UmMmMmm touch my body 
 Ooh, boy, just touch my body 
 I mean, girl, just touch my body"
"Yo, you know what I want? 
 I want the beat to drop in, right, like, now 
 Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy 
 I ain't crazy - you are crazy - at least I don't think I'm crazy 
 I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot you hot, but you crazy 
 Why they wanna? I don't know 
  
 It's the money that makes shit get ugly 
 It's the money that makes these hoes love me 
 It's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me 
 Man, I thought the money would make it all lovely 
 Yo, I actually write what I do and see 
 The felonies from day to day make me say what I say 
 When I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's 
 Don't cry for me, smile for me 
 And if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me 
 Remember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed 
 And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack 
 Let my tombstone read ""I Tried"" and from the start 
 Everything I wrote was from my heart 
 So it's always gon' be number one on my chart 
 I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art 
 Sometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin' 
 This shit is real, it ain't a game 
  
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine 
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine 
  
 First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big 
 I'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid 
 So I get vest up when I get dressed up 
 In the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up 
 If it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup 
 If you gossiping about me shut the fuck up 
 Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt? 
 When getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck 
 Duke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you 
 You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue 
 Right now what you need to do is give me the cash 
 Forget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass 
 Be a good boy now, go and get your stash 
 I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash 
 Alright, run along before I shoot ya ass 
 I hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash 
  
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine 
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine 
  
 I know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast 
 Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last 
 Man listen, if you really really like this shit 
 Nigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit 
 Call him now before I drop for real cause after I drop 
 I'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop 
 To each his own. Me? I'd get it while it was cheap 
 Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street 
 1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat 
 Niggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat 
 Give me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat 
 You're a generous guy, take 'em off or die 
 Man, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies 
 Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly 
 Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high? 
 See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye 
  
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine 
 They say the good die young 
 I guess these grimy niggas live a long time 
 Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine 
 Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

"You good, T-Minus? 
  
 Niggas been countin' me out 
 I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips 
 I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list 
 I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit 
 The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit 
 The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit 
 The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty 
 But that's how I like it, you all on my dick 
  
 I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get 
 I do not snort powder, I might take a sip 
 I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip 
 I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish 
 I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death 
 I got a few mil' but not all of them rich 
 What good is the bread if my niggas is broke? 
 What good is first class if my niggas can't sit? 
 That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit 
 Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips 
 Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist 
 This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift 
 Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss 
 They act like two legends cannot coexist 
 But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin' 
 If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit 
 It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame 
 It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same 
 It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers 
 It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane 
 Everything grows, it's destined to change 
 I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came 
 I hope that you scrape every dollar you can 
 I hope you know money won't erase the pain 
 To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now 
 Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground 
 I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style 
 I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now 
 Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice 
 Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise 
 This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions 
 I promise to slap all that hate out your voice 
  
 Niggas been countin' me out 
 I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips 
 I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list 
 I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit 
 The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit 
 The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit 
 The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty 
 But that's how I like it, you all on my dick 
  
 I just poured somethin' in my cup 
 I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel 
 Promise I am never lettin' up 
 Money in your palm don't make you real 
 Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck 
 I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel 
 If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck 
 Pistol in your hand don't make you real 
  
 I'm dead in the middle of two generations 
 I'm little bro and big bro all at once 
 Just left the lab with young 21 Savage 
 I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch 
 Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak 
 Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville 
 Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest 
 I wish that he had more guidance, for real 
 Too many niggas in cycle of jail 
 Spending they birthdays inside of a cell 
 We coming from a long bloodline of trauma 
 We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal 
 We hurting our sisters, the babies as well 
 We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well 
 Distorted self image, we set up to fail 
 I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga 
  
 I just poured somethin' in my cup 
 I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel 
 Promise I am never lettin' up 
 Money in your palm don't make you real 
 Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck 
 I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel 
 If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck 
 Pistol in your hand don't make you real 
  
 Money in your palm don't make you real 
 Pistol in your hand don't make you real 
 Money in your palm don't make you real"
"Money make a pimp, pimp hoes 
 Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what? 
 Money make the world go round as the world turns 
 Money make the world go round as the world turns 
  
 Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game 
 Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame 
 TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs 
 I slang weed, cocaine and heroin 
 50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain 
 You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change 
 Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range 
 Run away with ya Rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin' chain 
 Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang 
 Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playing 
 Better understand what I'm saying what I'm saying, I ain't playing 
 I'll be in front of your crib, laying, with the Mac to start spraying 
 Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame 
 Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane 
 Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain 
 That ho loose as hell, you better crack the whip, mang 
  
 A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin' hoes 
 A hustler ain't a hustler with no motherfuckin' dough 
 A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke 
 A player ain't a playa if his ass dead broke 
  
 I live life in the fast lane 
 Man I ain't got nothing to lose, everything to gain 
 Either you with me or against me man ain't nothing change 
 Nigga, you... go against the grain, I'll make you... walk with a cane 
 Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same 
 Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down with a gang 
 O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang 
 You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang 
 Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich 
 They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch 
 One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o 
 She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes 
 Ayo the bitch used to bring you dough, used to be your bottom ho 
 Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go 
 Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers 
 Politic with the willies the real shot callers  
 
 I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guiding me 
 Haters trying me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me 
 King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me 
 Representing sure tasters, the yay' keep taking pride in me 
 Streets Disciple slide-in me, status reports the badest 
 You caught walk in the black top with fat rocks and had his newport 
 I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back 
 Tore 'em up, get 'em ready to port, put 'em on the master track 
 I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimping 
 If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent 
 My nigga, live in trife, and that's real, talking shit on us 
 That's like pulling out a knife and don't kill, that's on the Trill 
 I'm on for million with your pit, in the clit that shit true 
 I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you 
 Without you even knowing got you stripping and even hoeing 
 You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showing 
  
 A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin' hoes 
 A hustler ain't a hustler with no motherfuckin' dough 
 A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke 
 A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke 
  
 Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines? 
 Is your bitch your bitch all the time? 
 You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines 
 Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch 
  
 Running from pimping, bitch you need to run to some pimping 
 With them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho 
 You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like 
 Look at you motherfucker here, huh bitch? 
 How you gonna catch some dates looking like that ho? 
 Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street 
 Bitch the sidewalk is for pimping bitch!"
"Get yours nigga 
 'Cause I'ma get mine 
 In due time 
 Everybody gotta shine 
 Get yours, I spray nines 
 I say this one time 
 The last time, I swear to y'all 
 I'm from where 
 The dope fiends is at 
 And killers crawl 
 And snitches call police 
 On these niggas, and street 
 Corners everybody's like 
 Smokin' marijuana and 
 Snuffin' niggas in faces and startin' drama and 
 Shootin' niggas, cold blood, just kill 'em, so what 
 With the fo' pound go nuts 
 Better slow up 
 Before you get your ass sewn up 
 Nigga never gon' grow up 
 Drinkin' the Henny 
 But he know he gon' throw up 
 Tryin' to make crack sales 
 What it look like? Future for a black male 
 Don't want to make my momma cry 
 On a front page for a homicide 
 Fly whips, all I wanted to drive 
 Where chicks get blunted and ride 
 Do 105 in the fast lane 
 And a fast pace, chasin' the papes 
 Spendin' chips on big chains 
 And the dimes that give brains 
 That was a 80s and 90s thing 
 Now I'm into big things 
  
 Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Gotta get my life together man 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I can't do that shit no more 
 Now I'm into big things  
 Nah, I can't fuck with you 
 I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners 
 I'm into big things 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things 
  
 When I started this 
 All I wanted was cars and cribs 
 Like other rap artists but 
 Do I know where I'm goin' to? 
 Can I forget when I came from? 
 I be showin' you 
 Another style I'ma flow for you 
 Can I make somethin' wild 
 I can throw for you, flow for you 
 Make it bi-coastal 
 Take it to heights 
 That some of y'all can't come close to? 
 Some of y'all 
 Want to talk like hoes 
 Worse than bitches 
 And when y'all niggas see me blow 
 Bet it hurt like stitches 
 No competition 
 I stop and twist 'em 
 Hit 'em like a mafia proposition 
 I rap and y'all stop and listen 
 Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in 
 Look up at a nigga, now 
 Rocks that glisten 
 Can't stop my mission 
 Make another LP drop 
 I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive 
 No time to get caught up in a crime 
 I ain't have shit to do with 
 Used to chase the hoes 
 Now I chase the dough 
 Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper? 
 No! 
  
 Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you 
 Now I'm into big things (ill) 
 Gotta get my life together man (uh huh) 
 'Cause now I'm into big things (big things) 
 Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more) 
 'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all) 
 You know I can't do that shit no more (why?) 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?) 
 I'm into big things 
 Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?) 
 I'm into big things (uh) 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things 
  
 I go past y'all (uh-huh) 
 Y'all got the glass jaw (uh-huh) 
 And when I hit it, admit it 
 Y'all on ya ass y'all (uh-huh) 
 We on the same team 
 You don't wanna pass the ball 
 Chuck and gunnin' for dough 
 You want to score 
 But you really don't know how to to ball 
 I put you on 
 It was me that introduced you to wealth 
 Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself 
 Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself 
 You ain't shit now 
 You was so ill, why you never came out? 
 Where ya clique now? 
 Where you sit now? In the back seat 
 Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat 
 Make you run laps like a pro athlete 
 And I done that 
 From my experiences 
 I appear relentless 
 Take more time 
 Just to hear my sentence 
 I'ma tell you what's real 
 And what could stop you from making a mil' 
 You could prevent this 
 When niggas don't see eye to eye to you 
 Lie to you 
 Wanna get high with you 
 Want to eat food off of your labor 
 And take food off your table 
 'Cause they don't see your vision 
 Don't understand your mission 
 Is to make history 
 While you here 
 How long you plan on livin'? 
 Not forever 
 At least to 140 
 Pray for me, I'm tryin' to eat 
 Like the niggas who bought 
 Motown off Berry Gordy 
 Good God 
  
 Nigga I'm tired of games 
 I'm into big things 
 Gotta get my life together man 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 Tired of talkin' small talk 
 'Cause now I'm into big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things  
 Man we already did that 
 Now I'm into big things 
 No time to get sidetracked 
 Now I'm into big things 
 Get money now besides that 
 Some more big things 
 I'm into big things 
 The big things 
 The big things"
"Google me bitch 
 I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch 
 Ha ha, ah won'tcha 
 Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, yeah 
 I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch 
 Try to Google me bitch, listen  
 
 I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian 
 Fuck with the kid, and I'll turn, into Damian 
 Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is 
 Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous  
 
 (Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way 
 of tellin y'all that God will make a way 
 I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day 
 Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway 
 Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team 
 You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans 
 When I ride by, well over 35 
 Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby  
 
 I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian 
 Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is 
 I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian 
 Google me bitch, wanna know, if I'm famous

 Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this  
 
 I'm urban, and ordained 
 Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane 
 Your little flame is like a flicker 
 And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter 
 I'm hard liquor 
 Cirrohsis of the liver 
 Black lung is what I deliver 
 That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga 
 Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community 
 Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me 
 I only bang shit true to me 
 With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me? 
 Nothin, I only bang shit true to me 
 With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?"
"Now is the time... 
 C'mon y'all 
  
 Stand tall, live your life to the limit 
 Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic 
 And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick 
 I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it 
 Now - every day I think about my color 
 And all the crazy shit we do to one another 
 I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother 
 Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother 
 If not, we gon' pull these triggers 
 Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz 
 I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus 
 bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness 
 You can too, you got the power to 
 Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you 
 I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you 
 But check it out I understand what you goin through 
  
  
 But remember, brothers and sisters 
 You can still, stand, tall 
 Just be thankful... 
 For what you got 
  
  
 I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh 
 Here comes another rapper with a song about hope 
 All you wanna hear is a song about dope 
 And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope 
 But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap 
 No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note 
 Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes 
 And some of our people used to hang from trees 
 Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ 
 So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right 
 Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke 
 I'm the sunlight, too bright to look 
 When it's all said and done I should write the book 
 You too cool for school, too old to know? 
 Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow 
 I understand, it ain't no love lost 
 But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus  
 
  
  
 Yeah, f'real 
 I was born in the mud but I came out clean 
 That's 'til the government tried to intervene 
 Tried to lock me up when I was only 19 
 Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream 
 I make shit raw that piss off the law 
 If you want some fake shit turn this off 
 If you want some realness I know you can feel this 
 Maybe we can heal this just like an illness 
 Black on black, I got'cho back 
 People don't think that we know how to act 
 Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack 
 And the CIA, won't take it back 
 Never on top, always on the bottom 
 Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham 
 Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten 
 Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em  
 
  
  
 Stand up, f'real... 
 Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit 
 Heh, in the belly of the evil empire"
"It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote) 
 It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked) 
  
  
 Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand 
 Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman 
 Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands 
 the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan 
 And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than 
 Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland 
 See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan 
 I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin 
 Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin 
 Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin 
 I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan 
 Maybe I need my head inside straightened 
 Brain contemplatin, clean out the register 
 Dip before somebody catches ya 
 or gets your description and sketches ya 
 The connection was the prime suspect 
 But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet 
 Cause I got a daughter to feed 
 And $200 ain't enough to water the seed 
 The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King 
 And have the lady at the desk bring 
 money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac 
 Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack 
 This bitch tried escapin the jack 
 Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote 
 You barely heard a word as she choked 
 It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked 
 But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke 
 Just then the pigs bust in yellin ""Freeze"" 
 But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's 
 And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees 
 So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees 
 I bust shots, they bust back 
 Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest 
 Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out 
 Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out 
 Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face 
 Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp 
 Drug her by her hair, smacked her up 
 Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up 
 Stole her car, made a profit 
 Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window 
 Like the girl in ""Set It Off"" did 
 Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal 
 Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool 
 Climbed out and collapsed on the patio 
 I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though 
 Parents screamin: ""Son, go in and call the police 
 Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"" 
 Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up 
 Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff 
 Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before 
 Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64 
 When they sell out in stores the price triples 
 I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles 
 and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries 
 There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties 
 Stood up and started to see stars 
 Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars 
 Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck 
 Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck 
 But I think somebody seen me maybe 
 Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby 
 Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits 
 Came out with a white flag hollerin ""TRUCE TRUCE"" 
 and surrendered my weapon to cops 
 Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps"
"Alchemist, you know me, man 
 I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes 
 Right on the spot in the studio soon as I hear the track 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Word, but I wanted to bring 
 A couple of books to the studio today, man 
 I found these shits up in the crib, man, in boxes, man 
 I don't even remember when I was writin' these shits 
 Or what's in these shits, man 
 Probably a bunch of bullshit, man... fuck it, check it 
  
 How can I trust you when I can't trust me? 
 Picture myself a old man, a O.G. 
 Some niggas will conversate with liars all day 
 Time pass- (Nah, let me start somethin' else) 
 Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns 
 I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns 
 I'm hexed, cursed, worse I been blessed first 
 I thought I was abnormal 
 'Cause I would overcome any tasked called to 
 So there it is, I'm a prince, I'm against lames 
 Who do minor shit, swear they on the top of they game 
 Your rhymin' is called ""Vagina Monologue,"" it kinda supports 
 Theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue 
 Rarely y'all come in contact with the real 
 Since Pun passed, he was the last shine of sun I could feel 
 Yo, said there's a few left since music's expressions of life 
 Damn, I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes 
  
 Oh shit, Tina! 
 I been lookin' for this bitch number, damn 
 No, this rhyme is weak 
 This is weak, I remember this bullshit right here 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Gandhi was a... what the fuck? 
  
 Gandhi was a fool, nigga, fight to the death 
 The US Army is a school that teach you plights of conquest 
 (I wonder when I wrote this... nah, it's weak) 
 The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life 
 Numbers is big business, makes the poor live trife 
 The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream 
 Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king 
 Pimps and card sharks, thieves, murderers with hard luck 
 Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society 
 Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety 
 Grow up watchin' well-dressed niggas with charms 
 Beautiful ladies on their arms 
 Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas 
 Rubbin' my lips with Campophenique 
 Still behind the ears wet, turned out to be 
 Pioneers vets amongst hustlers, crack sellers, and liars and squares 
 (Nah, that was weak there) 
 My people be projects or jail, never Harvard or Yale 
 Pardon me type in my two-way while I'm chargin' my cell 
 It's hard to be iced up with Gucci, God, poverty's real 
 I can't fight you, 'cause you would sue me, niggas be groupies 
 I see imitators tryin' to make albums, spittin' my style 
 And they don't even realize that I notice they stealin' Nas' shit 
 I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie 
 My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap 
 This can't be my book of rhymes 
  
 This can't be my book of rhymes, writin' this bullshit! 
 (My book of rhymes) 
 Nah, never that! Fuck that! 
 Aw, why you laughin', Alchemist? 
 Hah, you a funny nigga 
 Naw, yeah (My book of rhymes) 
 I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now 
 Fuck that! I'ma write again now, fuck that! 
 I musta been high on some shit... what the fuck is this?! 
  
 Look how we treat pregnancy, women in the hood 
 Our values so low, our values are no good 
 Things our mothers told us we should've heeded 
 'Cause now we need it, we older, almost able t- 
 I'm jealous of you, how come you so beautiful? 
 Smellin' fresh, youthful, intelligent, while I'm stressin' and shit 
 Ayo, I envy you 'cause all you do is smile 
 And things come your way 
 Such a innocent child is what some say 
 I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are 
 Like a star, not a worry in this world thus far 
 But wait a minute, we both need your mother's attention 
 I must be crazy, jealous of my own baby infant (Kinda crazy)"

 The world is mine, can't you see?

 Oh, yeah

 Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash 
 When I score with a whore, she be game for sure 
 Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor 
 Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it 
 Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege 
 I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it 
 See, you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it 
 And Big be that nigga, we be flyin' through your hood 
 And hood rats scopin' with their eyes on my goods 
 See, we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em 
 Treat 'em like we beat 'em, and never give up freedom 
 And we only give our number to selected few 
 And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do 
 Turn a freak to a bisexual 
 And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you

 Nigga play against some player shit, slugs gon' fly 
 Ain't gon' lie, pimped out her SSI 
 Nigga don't ask why, just respect it

 Pussy makes money, stick to the business 
 Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it 
 Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game 
 You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame 
 Say what you want, but I still figure 
 She left you 'cause you couldn't be like them real niggas 
 She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker 
 Than the average simps, found a badder pimp 
  
 Crazy ass man 
 I never would have bought that bitch all them cars 
 And all that shit you bought that hoe, man 
 After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe! 
 Man I'm 30 years old, nigga 
 And that bitch was hoein' when I was in 9th grade and shit

 Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man

 Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga 
 Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her 
 Stupid ass nigga, she ain't nothin' but a hoe! 
 Bet you fell in love with her man! 
 You can't turn a hoe into a housewife, fool

 Comes back to bite you in the ass 
  
 What I say in this disclosure (What?) 
 Y'all are stupid, you get shoulder (Hah) 
 Cause your plan was to get over 
 Since the days of Victrola 
 All the years of straight lies and deprivin' 
 Now I'm pushin' to take a dive and connivin' 
 We should never hear any cries from the guys 
 When independence we risin' high steady survivin' 
 Never ever had an artist wanna spray us 
 Cause when they do the fuckin' work, they know we pay up 
 And I see the labels getting set to bust 
 Cause them people wanna bypass them and come direct to us 
 I mean those with no major, mo' ways to grow paper

 You've been greedy so believe me 
 Your thievery will indeed hit you right where your cheese be 
 For years you been dumb and hold the juice

"Uh, yeah, uh 
 Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days 
 Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair 
 His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me 
 Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me 
 It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer 
 I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya 
 'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water 
 Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order 
 Shit is plastic material, havin' no life 
 I crash whips and leave it no matter the price 
 As long as I survive, cop a new five 
 Circle the block where the beef's at 
 And park in front of my enemy's eyes 
 They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters 
 There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers 
 And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth 
 Watchin' your own murder reoccur 
  
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
  
 It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me 
 Got knocked, refused 3 to 9s, went to trial for me 
 Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust 
 Greed and contempt, no street is exempt 
 Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks 
 I sip shots, watching em hustlers pitch rocks 
 Oil paintin' pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain 
 Falling deep into the pits of the game 
 This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times 
 Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime 
 Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm saying why do we reside 
 In the ghetto with a million ways to die 
 Stayin' high to relieve the pain, breathin' in the game 
 Exhalin' guilt sin and shame, misery and strain 
 What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax 
 I stand back, hopin' I'll make it through tomorrow 
  
 My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes 
 Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business 
 Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders 
 But since I tasted paper it started losing the friendships 
 Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor 
 How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse 
 Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin' 
 Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones 
 Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex 
 And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des 
 Got guns when I'm with my daughter 
 Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence 
 She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons 
 Black princess it's a ugly world 
 I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl 
 Could you believe even my shadow's jealous 
 My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones 
 My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs 
 Though my songs come from the Father 
 I'm lonely... hold me, it's gettin' darker 
  
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning 
 For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto 
 For every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal 
 For every child that's born, and every nigga gone 
 And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning"
"Nigga, westside! 
 Westside in this motherfucker 
 Westside in this motherfucker right here 
 Westside in this motherfucker  
 
 Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin' 
 Packed in a Suburban 
 Screaming, ""Outlaw!"", runnin' on the curb 
 They never try me, 'cause right behind me a killer team 
 I get the word, cut the head off a nigga, like a guillotine 
 This Hennessy will keep me calm though 
 Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin' convo 
 Livin' like a Don in my own mind 
 Signal Kadafi, nigga, watch me with the chrome 9 
 All the time drinkin' champagne 
 Walk through the crowd, let the tramps hang 
 Niggas player hate but do a damn thing 
 Picture me doin' 80, down a one-way 
 Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play 
 So I gotta keep my eyes open 
 Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin' 
 My alibi, addictively 
 Like them other vile men, I'm marked for death 
 Spendin' my nights like it's the last one left; I'm an outlaw  
 
 Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on 
 Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone 
 I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor 
 Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher 
 I'm the last one left 
 Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on 
 Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone 
 I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor 
 Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher 
 Guess I'm the last one left  
 
 I got my back against the wall, gat chillin' by my balls 
 Prior to war is a rider nigga that's only 5'6"" tall 
 Napoleon only knows on we Outlaws, fuck fear 
 Better strap down to the fullest, 'cause we outchea 
 Thug passion all up in me, feelin' like I took some Henny 
 It ain't easy, I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of two pennies 
 What we got is rep, nigga, wanna pull their gat, nigga 
 He's only got my side 'cause they think 'Pac died, nigga 
 Blast niggas with our TEC's, takin' showers in our vest 
 'Pac, come and catch weight, nigga, we the last ones left  
 
 If we would've known the zone inside my own dome 
 Fresh outta jail, it was hell, but I'm finally home 
 Lookin' for niggas that was woofin' that shit 
 When I was locked back 
 Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when it cocked back 
 Fuck 'em all, they're bitches inside a world of weak 
 Bitch niggas be afraid to speak; we the last ones left  
 
 Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on 
 Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone 
 At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor 
 Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher 
 Like I'm the last one left 
 Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on 
 Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone 
 At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor 
 Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher 
 Like I'm the last one left  
 
 I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth 
 Me and my team super supreme, puttin' in work 
 I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, 'til it hurt 
 And I call Earl screaming, ""Fuck the world!"" 
 I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife 
 And wifey beefin', wanna know if she gon' see me tonight 
 And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got 
 And that's until I see Yak, and that's until I see 'Pac 
 Young know I lost a troll, somebody owed me down 
 And if the world was a girl 
 I'd stick my dick in the ground; fuck the world!  
 
 Westside in this motherfucker right here 
 Westside in this motherfucker... 
 Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here 
 Outlawz in this motherfucker 
 Westside in this motherfucker right here 
 Westside in this motherfucker... 
 Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here

"Yeah 
 We're more solid 
 Yeah 
  
 No comparison, we more solid than they are 
 Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr 
 Me and Flacko, they say we the new Wave Gods 
 Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God 
  
 Wake up out the bed scruffy, sparkin' my J 
 Shine my nickel plated then I'm startin' my day 
 My old lady called me baby, told her pardon my age 
 Twelve shells in the gauge like a carton of eggs 
 We goin' home like Eric Cartman, chromosomes on my conscience 
 Here's some niggas talkin' nonsense, call him Nasty Nastradamus 
 Rock the pearls and diamonds, break your promise, break her wallets 
 Break her heart and break the pockets, taking notes like guidance counselors 
 Aristocrat just like the Chancellor, the answer to the, uh, panhandlers 
 The corners with the mans is up, the jig is up, the scams is up 
 Yeah, they hands is up, lookin' in the crowd, yeah 
 Tryin' to fuck the world but my pants still up 
 Tryin' to invest to all, my G's before we rest in peace 
 Before we rest in peace 
 The rest is set, the record set, as soon as I release 
 The room is streets, I roam the streets with no security 
 They know a nigga overseas, uh 
 Kinda swag that's passed from your mom and dad 
 Prada bags and we cheesin' on them Calvin ads 
 Mighta peeped the billboards fifty feet when out in traffic 
 Staring at them naked pictures, shit, you bound to crash 
  
 No comparison, we more solid than they are 
 Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr 
 Me and Flacko, they say we the new Wave Gods 
 Shout to Max B, he could be home any day, God 
  
 A$AP Mob got Mass Appeal 
 Call up Nasty Nas, niggas hit the lick like, ah, ah, ah 
  
 Wake up out the bed, wrap my durag up 
 Say a prayer, I'm thankin' God that Mom dukes had us 
 Monotone style like Guru on some Preemo cuts 
 Crewneck by McQueen, go nuts 
 Jewels over my white hoodie like Juvie in '98 
 It's movies that I make 
 Peruvian white flake 
 It tore the community at a high rate 
 Adversity I faced 
 I roll my own gas to make sure that it's not laced 
 Damn, I used to hit the block hopin' they see me 
 Watchin' Video Music Box sittin' close to the TV 
 I was inspired by Whodini and Kool G 
 Got my first pair of J's, thought I was 2-3 (Air) 
 Invest in all my G's before we rest in peace 
 'Cause we sure to rest in peace 
 My shorty is a piece, a piece of mind, a dimepiece 
 I might buy her a piece of property 
 You might'a had some joints, but ain't nuttin' like me and Rocky seen 
  
 No comparison, we more solid than they are 
 Me and Hit-Boy, they say we like the new Gang Starr

"I'm about to lose my mind 
 You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time 
 I need a doctor, call me a doctor 
 I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life 
  
 I told the world one day I would pay it back 
 Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back 
 But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that 
 Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black 
  
 Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision 
 When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is 
 And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this 
 All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest 
  
 You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you 
 But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do 
 But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark 
 Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you 
  
 I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue 
 'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick 
 You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic 
 Or you gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause 
  
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time 
 I need a doctor, call me a doctor 
 I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life 
  
 It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas 
 You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy 
 But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more 
 Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form 
  
 Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself 
 Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help 
 Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor 
 I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are 
  
 It was you, who believed in me when everyone was telling 
 You don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth 
 You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you 
 Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm crying in this booth 
  
 You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours 
 But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more 
 But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me 
 Get up, Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause 
  
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time 
 I need a doctor, call me a doctor 
 I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life 
 Bring me back to life 
 Bring me back to life 
  
 (I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life) 
  
 It literally feels like a lifetime ago 
 But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though 
 You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes 
 Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke 
  
 Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left 
 They said they was riding to the death, but where the fuck are they now? 
 Now that I need them, I don't see none of them 
 All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him 
  
 Fucking back-stabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us 
 Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots 
 You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been? 
 You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots 
  
 And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat 
 Making wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards 
 One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving 
 I'll guarantee they'll scream, ""Dre, don't leave us like that man!"" 'cause 
  
 I'm about to lose my mind 
 You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time 
 I need a doctor, call me a doctor 
 I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life"
"I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sandifer 
 And all other lil' Young Niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas 
  
 As a Young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind 
 Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten 
 I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies 
 'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me 
 I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me 
 Lately I've been tryin' to make a mill-ion, can you blame me? 
 With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me 
 If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I 
 Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride 
 Put down the top, now we flossin' 
 Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window 
 Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good 
 Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs 
 And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad 
 But all we had was our hopes and dreams 
 Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends 
 As Young Niggas 
  
 He's the kind of G like everybody knows 
 (As a strung nigga) 
 He's always G'd up, from head to toe 
 (My memories as a young nigga) 
 Always got it blown like Al Capone 
 (Strung nigga) 
 He's the downest G I've ever known 
  
 Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died 
 That's when my momma started gettin' high 
 My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive 
 All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry 
 Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket 
 Let me get my dead homies high 
 Come follow me throughout my history, it's just 
 Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga 
 My only thing was to be paid 
 Life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shady, back in the days 
 We always found the time to play 
 But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray 
 Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis 
 Every stadium that I go, when will they change? 
 Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga 
 Remember how it was, to be a young nigga 
  
 He's the kind of G like everybody knows 
 (As a young nigga) 
 He's always G'd up, from head to toe 
 (My memories as a young nigga) 
 Always got it blown like Al Capone 
 (young nigga) 
 He's the downest G I've ever known  
 
 I'm tellin' you 
 ...to be young, have your brains and have every limb and all that 
 Yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it 
 Muh'fuckers need to just calm down 
 And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life 
 'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life 
 You dumb nigga 
  
 Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin' 
 Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin 
 Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real 
 And I will even if it kills me, my Young Niggas 
 Break away from these dumb niggas 
 Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure 
 Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin' 
 Puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin' 
 At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin' 
 Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day 
 I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse 
 The epidemic and diseases, what is the future? 
 The projects lookin' hopeless, where 
 More and more brothers givin' up and don't care 
 Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed 
 And I proceed to blow the track up, for Young Niggas 
  
 He's the kind of G like everybody knows 
 (for the young niggas) 
 He's always G'd up, from head to toe 
 (My memories as a young nigga) 
 Always got it blown like Al Capone 
 (this for nigga.., this for the young nigga) 
 He's the downest G I've ever known 
  
 He's the kind of G like everybody knows 
 He's always G'd up, from head to toe 
 He always got it blown like Al Capone 
 He's the downest G I've ever known  
 
 This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know) 
 Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right) 
 Them niggas that's thirteen and fourteen 
 Drivin' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy) 
 Young motherfuckin' hustlers (make that money boy) 
 Stay strong nigga 
 You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer 
 You know what I'm sayin'? (Go to school nigga, go to school) 
 Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here 
 You could be a lawyer (really doe) 
 Niggas gotta get they priorities straight 
 (Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker) 
 Really doe. Young Niggas. little RahRah 
 (sup nigga) Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy 
 (Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, Young Niggas)"
"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence 
 Sometimes, I did the same  
 
 (Woman moaning) 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 (If these walls could talk) 
 (Sex)  
 
 She just want to close her eyes and sway 
 With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on) 
 Exercise her right to work it out 
 It's true, it's true, it's true 
 Shout out to the birthday girls 
 Say hey hey, say hey hey, (Ah, girl) 
 Everyone deserves a night to play, play 
 She plays, only when you tell her no  
 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)  
 
 If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good 
 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me, I'm just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I'm here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around, demolition might crush  
 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)  
 
 If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep 
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that's my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don't know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I've been on the streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must've missed them 
 I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em 
 I'd rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush  
 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it)  
 
 If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late 
 Your destiny accepted your fate 
 Burn accessories and stash them on the yard 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening, no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me"" 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper 
 Walls can talk (Talk) 
  
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room"
"I'm about to spit this Venom my hearts full of rage pent-up aggression 
 I'm about to tear this be a new asshole I don't think they've learned their lesson 
 How the fuck you wanna talk rap in this generation but I don't get mentioned? 
 Like I ain't done more than 95% of these niggas independent 
 This level is not reachable they ain't never seen a man climb this high 
 No hooks my bait is the truth I spit I catch from a view that's fisheye 
 Rip tides as I wave them goodbye 
 You can't swim tsunamis 
 This beats getting flipped acrobatically bitch, I'm catching bodies 
 Load it up, I'm a son of a gun 
 Pistol whipping everyone who is not in my caliber 
 Verbal bullets get to flying on automatic, you can't Dodge if you are not a Challenger 
 I revolver around and orbit the earth 
 You're not planted anywhere on my calendar 
 Smith words in the West and on leap years I'm out sniping these lines out in Africa 
 Desert eagle gassing chambers within ye cerebral 
 Semi democratic even Mike Pence couldn't 2nd or amend bars this lethal 
 Fuck peace 
 They in the middle east for the oil 
 Root of evil, blood on the flag they been landing 
 So who's saying that it's not bout the soil? 
 I recoil 'cause I'm not one to politic 
 If I don't get voted in office I'm done with the remix and paying these homages 
 Cause I don't see no other candidate fit for position with this type of confidence 
 Who came in game off the bench and been killing these people and ain't on a scholarship 
 Just to be honest when most of comments are positive 
 Negative feedback is fuel to achieve more accomplishments hoping they don't put a sock in it please do opposite 
 Fan the flame 
 Fuck if they don't I'ma add my own oxidant 
 I don't need oxygen bitch I'm monogamous 
 Married the game but like Solomon my shit is real and dependent on me to produce and continue my reign 
 And that's why my temples the booth 
 I'm feeling diabetic in this generation 'cause they sugarcoating all the truth 
 Not the mention the penicillin (pen is sealing) and the inks blue 
 So like duke I bomb on these devils who never never follow through 
 Fuck 
 I'm official the government knows it 
 C.entral I.ntelligence has me on watch 
 They got a micro inside of the phone 
 So I don't talk like the hands on a clock 
 I don't do virtual I'm in reality your in the meta 
 Slave to a box fungible token, hot for a moment 
 Everybody gets to fuck like a thot thot thot thot 
 The illegitimate rap child 
 My style is a L.L.C 
 Limited and in the Company of greats with no backing or Liability 
 If you wanna make bets I'm ABC that's alpha 
 You beta's bet on me 
 I don't miss and if I remix a hit, the mind shifts to process it please repeat 
 Cause I spit this venom 
 My bite is extreme it may affect you depending on factors within the entanglement, I call the scheme 
 It could be bars on the surface or deep 
 That talk in the language of chasing your dreams or just some ridiculous shit to remind you that Dax is in a totally differently league 
 That venom 
 And it's not gonna stop 
 I got a hundred of these in the bag you better pray I don't drop 
 I see the evil, I see the rituals, I see the sinister plots 
 So I stay at war with these demons, a sinner but I'm still a soldier for God 
 You better give me space son I'm a star 
 Wars are fought and waged over art 
 If they invadher like darth 
 There will be no minds left to spark 
 I don't gotta act to play my part 
 I'ma shake pears I go to ham to let them think they'll ever get near 
 Like broadway bitch I'ma set the stage 
 Grease elbows then go investigate 
 I think somethings going in on in this day and age 'cause we stare while the problems escalate 
 And I estimate that in 33 years and 33 days the waters will rise and the climate will say that the humans on earth didn't care to change so their children will now have to suffer the fate and suffocate 
 But back to the rap shit 
 If I get too real you pigs will squeal and say Dax going bat shit 
 Well if I am a gotta perfect average 
 E.R.A spells era and this one ain't golden if Dax can't have it 
 Cause no one spits this truth even if they wanted to their minds can't grasp it 
 What happened 
 Rap used to be a skillful passion 
 Now they robbin it just like is baskins 
 The ice and the cream and the focus on fashion 
 Has got the masses divided in social classes obsessed with the size of asses living a fake life in Calabasses to feel valid that everybody thinks they want until they finally have it 
 Open eyes this is demise 
 We are currently living inside fucked up times 
 Mandates engaged the rise of violent crimes, depressions rates and death by suicide 
 808's to lower Shakras and divide 
 While the normacy of privacy's deprived 
 And the cancel culture vultures sit and hide 
 And then gas the light with lies on their device 
 And the people cry till eyes all realize real lies within the choice to picks a side not fall in line like sheep who can't decide where the grass is green or put the PESTS-A-SIDE 
 And the best advice that I can now provide is to life your life the best you can despite this evil crooked rollercoaster ride that your guaranteed not to survive"
"Bury me a G 
 Thug Life 
 Feel me  
 
 Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens 
 A young G gettin' paid over dope fiends 
 Fuckin' off cash that I made 
 Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play 
 I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn 
 And comin' home at 6 o'clock in the mornin' 
 Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize 
 Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride 
 Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door 
 Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four 
 Stuck on full, drunk again 
 Sippin' on gin with a couple of friends 
 Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps 
 Stickin' to the rules was a major sin 
 And if I die, let it be 
 But when it come for me, bury me a G  
 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G  
 
 More trouble than the average 
 Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage 
 Being a G, it ain't no easy thing 
 'Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game 
 And for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce 
 Wonder why it had to end like this 
 And to the G's you can feel my pain 
 Until the motherfucker gets born again  
 
 You thought it was a game kid, I'm not the nigga for playin' game 
 I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge 
 I'm on the rampage makin' runs for the Devil 
 Ain't nothin' on my mind will get me into trouble 
 I'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure 
 Get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (Break yo self) 
 I gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when I bust 
 Pull me to my death but I'm a G to the enemy  
 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G  
 
 I got nothin' to lose so I choose to be a killer 
 Went from bangin' to slangin', now I'm a dope dealer 
 All my life paid the price to be the boss 
 Back to school, broke the rules on gettin' tossed 
 Poppin' rocks on the block was a past time 
 Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine? 
 Don't cry, I die before they play me 
 From the cradle to the grave, bury me G  
 
 Straight thug kickin' it with the homies in the hood 
 Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, my bitch said I'm no good 
 I gives a fuck I spend my time in the dope spot 
 Never had no time for no bitch instead slangin' rocks 
 And bustin' caps on you punk ass marks 
 Fake ass G's, bitch niggas with no heart 
 I'm stayin' real 'til I'm 6 feet deep 
 So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G  
 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G  
 
 Stuck on full, Tanqueray got a nigga high 
 Lord knows I don't need another DUI 
 I led a Thug Life, heartless hustler 
 Just 'cause I fuck don't mean I trust her 
 Now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep 
 So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley 
 ""Is it cool to fuck?"" Is what I'm askin' 
 Bitch recognize game and started laughin' 
 Now I'm all in those guts and shit 
 Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick 
 'Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know 
 I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho 
 Lots of ho's get mad and shit 
 I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch 
 'Cause I doubt if I change, the game's a motherfucker 
 Real niggas turn to busters, Bury Me a G  
 
 I ain't got time for bitches 
 Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches 
 Even when I die, they won't worry me 
 Mama don't cry, bury me a G

"You cocked back 
 You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man 
 He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man 
 Missed him by inches, he sprinted 
 Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered 
 Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished 
 You took the life of him 
 The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him 
 Tight with him, why was he in the way? 
 Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day? 
 His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive 
 Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit 
 Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised 
 Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days 
 They never had no probs 
 Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage 
 These two different personalities had to collide 
 Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died 
 You ask why, 'cause of a 
  
 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose 
 Liars brag, you put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin 
 Accident murderer 
 You just an accident murderer 
  
 We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated 
 Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded 
 Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars 
 But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up 
 20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight 
 We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night 
 Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war 
 Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah 
 Memoirs of a rich nigga 
 Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers 
 New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer 
 You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo 
 Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique 
 Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips 
 In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul 
 This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't 
  
 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose 
 Liars brag, you put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin 
 Accident murderer 
 You just an accident murderer 
  
 Accident murderer 
 Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer 
  
 Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up 
 Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya 
 And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome 
 How they gon' kill that beautiful sister? 
 Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons 
 Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing 
 Tell me who you impressing 
 Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them 
 Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling 
 Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping 
 But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went 
 Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas 
 Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless 
 Wish I could build with him, but will he change really? 
 Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry 
 Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me 
 You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary 
  
 Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose 
 Liars brag, you put work in 
 You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin 
 Streets are full of em, read the bulletin

 Germaphobic, heteron 
  
 I am not for the faint of heart 
 My genetic build can build multi universes, the men of God 
 Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter 
 Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time 
 Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her 
 My son Enoch, it's the part two 
 When I inspire my children and make higher values 
 In my present moment I saw that through 
 Ask Whitney about my lust addiction 
 Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt 
 Set precedent for a new sacreligion 
 Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me 
 Asked God to speak through me, that's what you're hearing now 
 The voice of yours truly 
 Teleport out my home body for comfort 
 I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question 
 Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to 
 No, I don't blink like I used to 
 Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man 
 But still this man compared to nobody 
 Yesterday I prayed to the flowers and trees 
 Gratification to the powers that be 
 Synchronization with my energy shackles that goes to doctor Zebi 
 Paid it for, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy 
 Sciatical nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel 
 Like the first time I fucked a white bitch 
  
 The first time I fucked a white bitch, I was sixteen at the Palisades, fumblin' my grades 
 I traveled with a team, the apache life, Sintennio was like 
 When Mrs. Becker screamed, ""That dough, boy, mixed there with purple rain"" 
 They interchanged the seams 
 Happy just to be out the hood, with all the wealthy years 
 Credit cards and family plans, she drove her daddy's Benz 
 I found out he was a sheriff, that was a win-win 
 Because he had locked up Uncle Perry 
 She paid her daddy's sins 
 Next time I fucked a white bitch, was out in Copenhagen 
 Good Kid, M.A.A.D City tour, I flourished on them stages 
 Whitney asked did I have a problem 
 I said, ""I might be racist"" 
 Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

 And thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones 
 Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known

 Anything along the land we consumin', eatin', deletin', ruin 
  
 Tryin' to get paper, gotta have land, gotta have acres 
 True 
 So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson, watch niggas play the game like the Lakers 
 In a world full of fifty-two fakers, Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers 
 You superstitious, throw salt over your shoulders, make a wish for the day 'cause 
  
 Like somebody got a doll of me, stickin' needles in my arteries, but I can't feel it 
 Sometimes it's like, ""pardon me, but I got a real big spirit"" 
 I'm fearless, I'm fearless, don't you try and grab hold of my soul 
 It's like a military soldier since seven years old 
 I held real dead bodies in my arms, felt they body turn cold, oh 
 Why we born in the first place if this is how we gotta go? Damn 
  
 Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (yeah) 
 Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye (yeah, yeah, what) 
 Ni kera mogo 
 Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (this goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the world) 
 Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni (Sabali, patience, yeah) 
 Ni kera mogo"
"Yeah 
 It's my life 
 My own words I guess 
 Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? 
 Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? 
 When they know they're your heart 
 And you know you were their armour 
 And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her 
 But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you? 
 And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you? 
 What happens when you become the main source of her pain? 
 ""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane 
 ""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"" 
 I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy 
 Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself 
 I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself 
 Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her 
 And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her 
 That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy 
 Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 Things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be 
 Like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry 
 Talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang 
 How you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name? 
 Get ya business right boys, the first class is in session 
 Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession 
 Start up ya own company, trademark the name 
 That's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change 
 Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps 
 Sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks 
 Hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need 
 Whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed 
 Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered 
 Sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard 
 Show all the non-believers what you destined to be 
 And in just a couple years you could be rich like me 
 But I can't hold my tongue 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking 
 I run it myself like a quarterback option 
 I pitch a 10 g's tell a bitch to go shopping 
 She buy herself some clothes, and she bought me back a chopper 
 See niggas tryna kick it, but no I don't play sucker 
 I'm all about my cake I'm tryna marry Betty Crocker 
 A package on the way you know my whip game proper 
 And enough for one key I see seventy thousand dollers 
 Now I was shooting dice, smoking on a joint 
 I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points 
 We ova here hustling, we ova here grinding 
 You rap about money and nigga might sign ya 
 You rap about me and a nigga might find ya 
 Banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya 
 Dope game bitch let his mamma worry bout him 
 You can holla at me for a fee 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away 
 Lying by my side 
  
 You look like you're in another world 
 But I can read your mind 
 How can you be so far away

"It is absolutely silly, and unproductive 
 To have a funeral for the word ""nigga"" 
 When the actions continue 
 We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters 
 Not a funeral for niggers 
 Cause niggers don't die 
  
 Uh, yeah 
 Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin', in your sink and your toilet 
 I be drinkin' from your spit, anything cause I'm all less 
 An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead 
 Correction: I got eight legs, climbin' on top yo' plate, bed 
 Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food 
 Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool 
 The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to 
 Fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath 
 Your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of 
 Your pesticide or RAID cause, in heaven's my Creator 
 I love it when the light's off, eatin' from same knives, forks 
 From, any man's dinner, see my antennas 
 You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make 
 If you squash me, learn to live with me 
 How much your roach motel costin' you in the city? 
 But yo, we everywhere, check your house good, I bet we there! 
 Look there! 
  
 Niggers are like roaches - they're never gonna go away 
 Learn from them what we should not become 
 Cause niggers don't die"
"I think it has the potential to be something massive 
 Like not just a fuckin bullshit ass EP we just drop after Halloween, you know what I'm saying? 
 I think it's something that'll prompt me to do more of 
 You know people be like OK, we can fuck with that kind of stuff"
"Yo 
 I'm in rare form 
 Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for em 
 Talk about back in the days 
 This isn't back in the days 
 They want me back in my ways 
 Chipped tooth and the fade 
  
 Uh 
 Musically I'm on Mars 
 Walking all over the beat 
 Puttin my feet on the stars 
 I rock it like Lenny, thinkin like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar 
 Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and we gotta know who we are 
  
 Uh 
 I'm in rare form 
 Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan this a fair warning 
 Too many young gods beef over nothin 
 When you get money you know that it's comin 
 Sayin' they homies but they ain't a hunnid 
 We the most hunted uh 
 I got my Mets hat on to the back 
 Y'all already know where we going with the stats 
 Hall of Fame only Kings and Queens only 
 They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me 
  
 Yeah 
 I'm in rare form 
 Y'all still on the ground you know I been airborne 
 Studying BIG studying Nietzsche 
 You gotta call in a chopper to reach me 
 Homey I don't need a jeweler to freeze me 
 Ice in my veins I make it look easy 
  
 Mentally I'm in Queens 
 More money more problems you gotta be ready for all that it brings 
 Let em say what they say revenge on my plate I'm lovin' the taste 
 They see you shinin' emotions get hard to contain 
 They just not evolving the same 
 Me and HB is too rare 
 I'm movin' all thru the snares 
 Sound on billionaire 
 Ain't nothin' changed I'm flippin' the page 
 I'm Prince on the stage, slave on his face 
 You know what they say, KD the wave 
 I'm stayin' rare for all of my days 
  
 I'm stayin' rare for all of my days 
  
 Levels of Tarantino 
 Curbin' my ego, even though he know 
 Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos 
 What they especially praise is the ethos 
 Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips 
 No superstition to make me get rich 
 I'm with this chick just one I brought today 
 In between placing my bets we shopped at Cartier 
 Rose gold I copped her a set 
 Runway hopped in the jet 
 Flight attendant poppin' Moet 
 I said I need that Dom off of respect 
 We havin' conversations niggas show me property there 
 I called my nigga Ant and told him yo I gotta be there 
 Salmon shish kabob in a misty fog rollin' sticky log 
 Big dog affair no kids involved 
 Round table havin' war council 
 Press one button it'll change the world around you 
 Too rare, nuttin' to see here 
 Cuban over my streetwear 
 You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair 
 It's ok to keep the mystique I learned that in the street 
 On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's 
  
 We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time 
 Look inside my mind, see a gold mine 
 I'm my own co-sign 
 She textin' the old line 
 You keep staring at the glow bitch don't go blind 
 Braveheart energy, fuck all the enemies 
 XO Hennessy it's not on me it's in me 
 I'm not here to be friendly they ain't even contending

"I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
  
 I know how it feel to wake up fucked up 
 Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell 
 People look at you like you's the user 
 Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad Buddha-abuser 
 But they don't know about your stress-filled day 
 Baby on the way, mad bills to pay 
 That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce 
 And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit 
 I remember I was just like you 
 Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62s 
 'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G 
 I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me 
 She was forced to kick me out, no doubt 
 Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South 
 Packed up my tools for my raw power move 
 Glock 19 for casket and flower moves 
 For chumps tryin' to stop my flow 
 And what they don't know will show on the autopsy 
 Went to see Papi to cop me a brick 
 Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it 
 Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court 
 For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York 
 Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man 
 You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man 
  
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
  
 I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland 
 With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects 
 They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs 
 And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?"" 
 I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack 
 In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash 
 I wait for hon to make some quick cash 
 I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed 
 At last, I'm literally loungin', black 
 Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks 
 Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps 
 Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps 
 See who got smoked, what rumors was spread 
 Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head 
 Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder 
 We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter 
 Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of 
 By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners 
 And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch 
 I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich 
 Conspiracy, she'll be home in three 
 Until then I looks out for the whole family 
 A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble 
 In the everyday struggle 
  
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right) 
  
 I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani 
 Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti 
 My daughter use a potty so she's older now 
 Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now 
 Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes 
 Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes 
 In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain 
 The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange 
 Breakin' days on the set, no sweat 
 Drunk off MoÃ«t, can't bag yet because it's still wet 
 But when that dry, baggin' five at a time 
 I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line 
 I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word 
 Thick in the game, Ds knew my first name 
 Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared 
 Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes 
  
 And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker 
 Hah, come on, what you say? 
  
 I don't wanna live no more 
 Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door 
 I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
 Another day, another struggle (Right)

"I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away 
 When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day 
 Did counseling, couldn't force me to stay 
 Something happens when you say I do, we go astray 
 Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all 
 Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault 
 He in the grave - let it go, he no longer living 
 Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women 
 Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck 
 Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up 
 No matter who you fuck, that was before me 
 Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming 
 ""Hate you so much right now"" 
 Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman 
 Actions of a demon, I'm leaving 
  
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby) 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave 
 Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed 
 Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years 
 You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird 
 Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow 
 Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know 
 I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches 
 I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin 
 Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally 
 Better than you knew yourself - and I knew this for certain 
 Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody 
 You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably 
 The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!"" 
 Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night 
 Bailed you out, next morning we got clean 
 Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game 
 Just another day in the life of two people in love 
 But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what 
  
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby) 
 Oh! Oh! Ah! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 I can't believe that this is happening to us 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition 
 Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending? 
 With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half 
 Not some, but half, no, serious, half 
 Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind 
 It's either that or die, I wanted peace of mind 
 And all I seen was selfish cowards 
 Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?"" 
 But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh! 
 You live with your baby moms 
 And scared to make an honest woman out of her 
 And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive 
 At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride 
 Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride 
 He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes 
 Next go round I hope I pick the truest type 
 And watch me do it all again - it's a beautiful life, aight? 
 Goodbye! 
  
 (Bye baby) Baby baby 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby) 
 I can't believe that this is happening to us 
 'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing 
 You know I'm saying bye-bye 
 I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 
  
 'Til we make love just one more time 
 Make it seem forever 
 This is our last and final goodbye 
 Goodbye"
"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show 
 A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe 
 Was the start of something good 
 Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood 
 Just tryna find that hookup 
 Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh) 
 Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling 
 Off instrumentals, had my pencil, and plus, my paper 
 We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur 
 Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light 
 Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock 
 Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop 
 Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move 
 But we not making no G's and that's a no-no  
 
 Check it, a-one-two, a-one 
 ""Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,"" they call us 
 Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers 
 Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging 
 Niggas say ""motherfuck that playin'"", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals 
 Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry 
 ""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"" 
 Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly 
 '96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me 
 I'm out this bitch 
  
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
  
 Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger 
 Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit 
 Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled 
 Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys 
 Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk 
 Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys 
 And they looking like Halle Berrys 
 So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine 
 We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high 
 Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug 
 And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood 
 Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing 
 But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now"" 
 We moving on up in the world like elevators 
 Me and the crew, we pimps like '82 
 Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone! 
 Like this, East Point and we gone 
  
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors  
 
 Got stopped at the mall the other day 
 Heard a call from the other way that I just came from 
 Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey, man, you remember me from school?"" 
 ""No, not really"" 
 But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly 
 And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive? 
 I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes 
 From all them songs that y'all done made"" 
 And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had 
 True, I've got more fans than the average man 
 But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week 
 I live by the beat like you live check-to-check 
 If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck 
 Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes 
 From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue 
  
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you 
 Your momma and your cousin, too 
 Rolling down the strip on Vogues 
 Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors 
 Me and you"

 Wait until tonight, girl 
 Ah man 
 If you think you're lonely now 
 Wait until tonight, girl

 Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman 
 I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR

 Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic 
 Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic

 Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on 
 Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic 
 Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit 
 Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me 
 City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me 
 I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk 
 Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park 
 Bull's eye right through her head, to her heart 
 It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you 
  
 You gon' get it, you gon' get it 
 I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl) 
 Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha) 
 I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?) 
 When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl) 
  
 I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack 
 2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that 
 The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason 
 I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin' 
 Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind 
 My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time 
 It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene 
 The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream 
 Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream 
 Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between 
 Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine 
 When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine 
 See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on 
 It's showtime, it's my turn to perform 
 Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good 
 She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would 
  
 You gon' get it, you gon' get it 
 I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl) 
 Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha) 
 I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?) 
 When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)"
"There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feeling alright 
 I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down 
 'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown 
 And I know it's not my time to go now 
 'Cause God's got my back in this showdown 
 So I know we'll be alright 
  
 Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth as Hall & Oates 
 Briefcase, silk ties, slick as them older folks 
 Silver fo'-fo', cocked? No 
 My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali 
 Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window 
 Kinda' see my father's features creeping in a little 
 Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica 
 Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her 
 And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize 
 I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise 
 And I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me 
 But God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me 
  
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And all this drama's got me feeling uptight 
 I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo 
 Cause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard 
 Holding our baby in her baby in her arms 
 So hold on, your daddy's in sight 
  
 Yeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes 
 For the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying 
 Planned to be a strong black family 
 But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing 
 Newcomer called Verbal Assassin running with 
 Nothing but the worst type, worst fight 
 When we brought my baby home the first night 
 Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging 
 In my new car bought from entertainment 
 Champagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash 
 Did this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass 
 Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me"" 
 I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi 
 Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine 
 She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again 
 Squeezing the pen, released again, chart toppers 
 Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems 
 New woman, she's great, this a different world 
 Checking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl 
 It's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy 
 I'm grown up and thankful for lessons God gave me 
  
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feeling alright 
 I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down 
 'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown 
 And I know it's not my time to go now 
 'Cause God's got my back in this showdown 
 So I know we'll be alright 
  
 From the day you was born 
 Your daughter Destiny, was one of your destinations"

 Some bitches changed, 'cause they know I'm fitting to blow 
 You should see how they react when I come through the door 
 In the club my niggas, we fitting to ball out, drink till we fall out 
 Some shit jump off, nigga we going all out 
 Shots big enough to tear the fucking wall out 
 I'll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryna crawl out

"What y'all know about this fab shit, huh? 
 TE, baby, come on, Trackmasters  
 
 Look we can shop together, mama, his and hers 
 Fifth Ave. shit, baby, Fendi furs 
 I ain't tight with the chips, girl, I'm down to splurge 
 If it's ice you like I'll light up your life 
 VS2 clarity, aight? 
 I play the block, I ain't the type to punch a clock 
 I'm the type to put the pedal to the floor in the drop 
 I live life in the fast lane, I mix dro with hash 
 Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass 
 It's like she loves me, she loves me not 
 Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit a lot 
 I gave her jewels that I caught of a jux 
 Chanel bags I bought from boosters 
 To the hood I introduced her 
 She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me 
 People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon' write me 
 The sick part is all that bullshit excites me  
 
 A thug's what I want, a thug's what I need 
 Even though my friends don't seem to see 
 That he lace me with money 
 He knows when I want it 
 And I'm never gonna leave my baby 
 My thugged out no good baby  
 
 Ayo, I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special 
 Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you 
 When I met you it was Guess and Gap, now it's Gucci and Prada 
 Took you from being a nine to being a dime 
 You complain that we don't spend time 
 When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine 
 Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me 
 When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some bubbly 
 See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly 
 She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip 
 Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits 
 That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey 
 Now she wanna OD 
 You know me, I let her do her thing, son 
 I say what I'm feeling, niggas say that I'm illing 
 I sip Cristy so I'm pissy like a staircase in your building 
 What?  
 
 A thug's what I want, a thug's what I need 
 Even though my friends don't seem to see 
 That he lace me with money 
 He knows when I want it 
 And I'm never gonna leave my baby 
 My thugged out no good baby  
 
 A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need 
 And my friends don't understand how my baby laces me 
 A thug is what I want and a thug is what I need 
 And my friends don't understand and I think it's jealousy"
"In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli"". 
 Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement. 
 Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well. 
 Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac-excuse me-Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. 
 Jay Z, from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. 
 The question everybody wants to know is: 
 Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac-rather Makaveli-was not available for comment, but released this statement:  
 
 It's not about East or West 
 It's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks - which side are you on?  
 
  
 These niggas is still fucking talking? 
 You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight 
 Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches 
 Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don) 
 Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass) 
 (Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo Shit, Bring it!  
 
 Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don 
 Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an 
 Niggas get shook like 5-0 
 My .45 is next to me when we ride for survival 
 Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets 
 Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it 
 Expose snakes 'cause they breed freely 
 See me ride! Located worldwide like the art of graffiti 
 I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty 
 Born on a dope fiend's titty 
 In every city you'll find me 
 Look for trouble right behind me 
 My Outlaw niggas down to die for me 
 Know what I mean? I hit the scene 
 Niggas ducking from my guillotine stare 
 I'm right there, my every word a fucking nightmare 
 Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall 
 This for my dogs down to die for y'all 
 Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em 
 Cut 'em down, to hell is where we send 'em 
 My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die 
 Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry 
 Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater 
 Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters"" 
 And not a whimper until I'm gone 
 Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong 
 Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride 
 Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry 
 I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too 
 Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you 
 Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe 
 How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay 
 West Coast rider, coming right behind ya 
 Should have never fucked with me 
 I want money, hoes, sex and weed 
 I won't rest until my road dog's free; bomb first  
 
 We bomb first when we ride 
 Please, reconsider before you die 
 We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight 
 But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first 
 We bomb first when we ride 
 Please reconsider before you die 
 We ain't even come to fight tonight 
 But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first  
 
 For so many days, in so many ways 
 We've been ducking strays they delivers 
 But still we some Bad Boy killers 
 Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go 
 I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row 
 With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general 
 And I be a soldier on a mission 
 Sent to do what you'll never do 
 And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause 
 You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch 
 Yo, I'm dying with yours 
 Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi 
 Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi"" 
 If you ain't in this rap game 
 For the motherfucking cash, mane 
 Then what is your motherfucking purpose? 
 Non can serve us 
 E.D.I. Mean, born worthless 
 That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch  
 
 Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it! 
 Then we ride 
 Come on, bring it 
 Bomb first then we ride 
 Hey, get that nigga!  
 
 Your style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather 
 Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough 
 Half rapper, half drug kingpin 
 You're telling fairy tales, dunn 
 ""King of New York"" like you the motherfucking one? 
 But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit 
 From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips, gettin' rich, even though it's hard 
 Trying to creep through these halls and brawls 
 Without scarred by a revolve 
 With no warning signs, 'cause yo, my man took five 
 Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time  
 
 Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding 
 Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me 
 We bomb first when we ride 
 Please reconsider 'fore you die 
 G's and thug niggas on the rise 
 Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first 
 We bomb first when we ride 
 Please reconsider 'fore you die 
 G's and thug niggas on the rise 
 Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first  
 
 Let us pray, my niggas 
 For we have definitely sinned"
"I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya 
 In case your dumbass wanna tussle 
 AR-15, co-exist to make the shell case muffle 
 Scope, infrared, run you're still dead 
 Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head 
 Contract killa, murder for the scrilla 
 Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga 
 Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga 
 Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy 
 You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready 
 No exception to the rule, death is promised 
 Plus I just bought my niggas new macs and llamas 
 Got respect for human life but will accomadate you. 
 One phone call and niggas will exterminate you 
 I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine 
 Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind 
 They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind 
 Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time 
 Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll 
 In that new Rolls with the suicide doors 
 22 inch chrome, a nigga money low 
 You try to touch me, I put out ya get ya brains blown 
 You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own 
 You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome 
 The ice blowin' my chain, blood blue in my veins 
 Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang 
 The semi auto spray, run if you get away 
 I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day 
 In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggas don't know I'm around 
 Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down 
 You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress 
 Hard niggas finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em 
 You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em 
 Its real killa instinct, kill or be killed 
 Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel 
 Fuck around and get ya cap peeled 
 nigga you know the drill, Brownsville 
 Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo 
 Feed the wolves, they eat the food 
 And the hand that feed 'em too 
 nigga welcome to the jungle, New York New York 
 Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk 
 I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some crippes 
 I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips"
"Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep 
 Tryin' to diss now too, huh?! 
 Hahaha! Well, I ain't prejudiced 
 I don't give a fuck 
 This is what it sounds like 
 When we ride on our enemies 
 Biatch! When we ride on our enemies 
  
 Hey, got some static for some niggas on the other side of town 
 Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now 
 What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas? 
 Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas 
 Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us 
 Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust 
 To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come 
 Shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die? 
 Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me 
 Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie 
 Then, we watch the other two die slow 
 Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow 
 Bam! Set my plan in mo' 
 Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes 
 Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot 
 My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop 
 When we ride on our enemies 
  
 When we ride on our enemies 
 I bet you motherfuckers die 
 When we ride on our enemies 
 When we ride on our enemies 
 Bet all you motherfuckers die 
 When we ride on our enemies 
  
 Come take a journey through my mind's eye 
 You crossed the game, don't explain 
 Nigga, time to die; say goodbye 
 Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger 
 So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga 
 Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits 
 Niggas love to scream ""Peace!"" after they start some shit 
 Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me 
 I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep 
 Don't fuck with me! 
 Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell? 
 See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well 
 Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved? 
 See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball 
 Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed 
 Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz 
 Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD 
 Know I meant every motherfuckin' word 
 When we ride on our enemies 
  
 When we ride on our enemies 
 Make sure everybody die 
 When we ride, on our enemies 
 When we ride on our enemies, hehe 
 I make sure everybody die 
 When we ride, on our enemies"

 If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin' 
 I kiss like the French do, I put my tongue in your ear 
 Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair 
 For me a different scenery just mean a different position 
 In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen 
 In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club 
 I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love 
 But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know 
 Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those 
 See I see something special when I look in your eyes 
 With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine 
 If you ain't sure when I'm talking I don't tell you no lies 
 But there's things that you say that have me wondering why 
 When I don't say what I'm thinking it don't mean that I'm shy 
 Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

 If I was your best friend 
  
 While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back 
 When you putting on your lotion I can help you with that 
 I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile 
 Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style 
 Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk 
 And if I'm focused while I'm stroking I could change how you walk 
 That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York 
 I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought 
 Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best 
 If there's a price to pay for feeling you I pay that twice 
 I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right 
 I ain't got nothing to hide baby I tell you my secrets 
 'Fore you end up being 'round long enough to peep shit 
 I get closer to you, I mean closer than close 
 I get into you, after I take off my clothes 
 Girl I been into you, mentally long before 
  
 If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

 Uhh!  
 
 Remember being introduced to rappin' your first rhyme? 
 It's pivotal! - Like a fiends first high. 
 Hustlers first ride, - players first dime, 
 Unforgettable like the ladies first time. 
 The world been waitin' for euphoria 
 The true form with a sixth sense. - New nausea. 
 True talk to the tomb, so you forced me to go hard 
 Like the streets is the womb - and New York 
 Be the birth place of Hip-Hop. - Get it? It's the model! 
 Where swagger was born, we set trends to follow. 
 The home of the gods, the go-getters and my flow 
 Ain't a city been so prolific since Cairo. 
 Hiero-glyphic. - Graffiti paint of view 
 Slang languages, too, just naming a few. 
 Still claiming through that thing that you do 
 Til you famous and just love for the game and this bangers for you!  
 
 Euphoria... - Euphoria, natural high. (high!) 
 Feeling good off this Hip-Hop I supply. ('ply!) 
 Time goes by. (by!) - Still world wide (wide!) 
 Still top five rapping, dead or alive! ('live!) - Euphoria...  
 
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  
  Euphoria!  (you wronged the shit!) 
 The world been waiting for euphoria... (salute!)  
 Euphoria...  
 
 I love Hip-Hop to death! (I love it!) 
 Drop science like Rakim. - My thoughts manifest. (yeah!) 
 Yeah, I'm the Ghost but you can see me in the flesh (see me?!) 
 Created a father that he can see me through the test. (see me!) 
 It wasn't for rap, my life will probably be a mess (mess!) 
 Used to sell crack outside. (true!) 
 Had a bad attitude, used to scrap outside (true!) 
 But listen to that motherfucker rap outside! (yeah!) 
 You can hear me over the guns that clap outside (you been!) 
 True warrior raps my euphoria. (I love it!) 
 Only my mind can bring me this many stories up (only my minbd!) 
 No elevators! - No escalators! (uh-uh!) 
 Spit hard 'til death or respirators (spit hard!) 
 This is alpha-omega, nigga. - Get your data! (get your data!) 
 I transform when the mic' plugged in 
 Cause the feelings euphoric. - Cause I spit boric! (yes!)  
 
  
  
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  (uh!) 
  Euphoria!  (uh-huh!) 
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  (HA-HAAAAAAAAHHH!) 
 Euphoria... (uh, yo!)  
 
 At the end of the day - what does it all amount to? (what?) 
 Verses too strong to be sold over the counter. (drugs!) 
 Industry is like a night club and I'm a bouncer (haha!) 
 I don't give a fuck about what you can sell and ounce for. 
 Nah! - That ain't the topic of discussion 
 It's the music, y'all niggas think it's knocking it's disgusting. (uh-huh!) 
 I just rather pull it out, cock it then bust him! 
 Feels like he plugged into a socket when you touch him! (hahhh!) 
 Ain't a thang for me! (nah!) - Pain then glory. (yeah!) 
 Temporary thug exchange the same story. 
 That's why I'm still militant. - Still killing it! 
 Soon as it enters the blood stream; start feelin' it. (uhh!) 
 Then it's all good long as you know what you dealin' with (uh-huh!) 
 Knowledge of the game that I got I'm concealin' it. (yup!) 
 I'm talking to all of y'all (all of y'all!) - put the.four-four to ya 
 Kiss is a warrior. (warrior!) - This is euphoria! What?!  
 
  
  
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  (yeah!) 
  Euphoria!  (yeah, yeah, yeah!) 
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  
 Euphoria... (ayo, ayo!)  
 
 It's like I'm dealin' with spirits and 'bout to send a ghost to get 'em 
 When they hear me spit I make them tremble like the dope was in 'em. (AHHHH!) 
 Going into convulsions from the size of the weed bag, 
 Victims is regular junkies, this celebrity rehab. 
 Respected by all of the godfathers and the new names 
 They got a love for my product insert it in their blue vein. (okay!) 
 They on my neck when I come around like a new chain 
 Niggas know my rep and the dosage when I bring the new flame. (ufff!) 
 Niggas all feeling the same effect, this shit is lethal, 
 Like they was shooting the same shit, using the same needle. (whooop!) 
 When I'm steady busting hollows I'm always ready to start this 
 You niggas is like? when I'm? the cartridge (ha!) 
 You can see how the drug impacted the street from the responses, (yeah!) 
 It saturate the planet was all apart of the process. (yeah!) 
 The shit we get we take it to another place, you can't ignore it! 
 To a higher stimulation, nigga, shit is so euphoric!  
 
  
  
 The world been waiting for euphoria...   
  Euphoria!  
 The world been waiting for euphoria...  
 Euphoria"
"I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia 
 Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album 
 You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right"" 
 But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum 
 Powder-how's about them oranges? 
 Moved away from home to school with big plans 
 By day, studied the history of music 
 By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance 
 To get your pants was a Mission Impossible 
 We were both the same age, but I 
 Suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in 
 The same book of life, so I'd page you when 
 I felt you that were getting off of work 
 Or either when you're on your way to school 
 We started hanging like Ernie and Bert 
 And in my idle head I'm thinking, ""Cool"" 
 Just when I think I'm going down your shirt 
 You're hiking up your skirt now 
 The events that followed had me volley 
 If your hometown would be heaven or hell 
 The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best 
 Therefore, hard to tell 
 You'd drop me off by the Dungeon 
 Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering 
 ""Now, are these niggas in this house up to something? 
 Selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?"" 
 W-W-Well, yes and no 
 Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow 
 Cook it in the basement then move it at a show 
 Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, ""Ho!"" 
 Meanwhile, the video starts playing 
 BET, college radio, and a van 
 Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand 
 And one in their ear, you know what I'm saying, but 
 I kept your number in my old phone 
 Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam 
 So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits 
 But I promised I would call you when I got home, but 
 When I got home, I never did 
 By the time I did, heard that you'd had a kid 
 By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later"" 
 When he got the good news; that's life, shit 
 Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac 
 My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack 
 Got a plaque, but I'm living with my pop-pop 
 So I got a Glock and a LoJack 
 Yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw 
 And never said much, 'cause half of what he saw 
 Was so far from that place you wanna be 
 That words only fucked it up more, follow me 
 Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at? 
 Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back 
 But keep in mind, at the time, ""keep it real"" was the phrase 
 Silly when said now, but those were the days 
 When Spring Break and Daytona and Freakniks 
 Made you wanna drop out of college and never go back 
 Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak 
 Moment, on went myself and Big Bo- 
 Well, you knew him as 'Twan 
 That's right, you were around before this shit begun 
 Well 'Twan had a daughter and 
 Sorta was made to mature before the first tour 
 We hit the road like Jack 
 Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak 
 Girls used to say, ""Y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?"" 
 And I'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling 
 ""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby, he from Savannah, maybe 
 We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we 
 Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes"" 
 She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants 
 15-Love, fit like glove 
 Description is like fifteen doves 
 In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost 
 Making one woozy in the head and comatose-agree? 
 Enough about me, how's about you? How's the lil' kid? 
 She was about two the last time we spoke 
 I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink 
 'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note 
 Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off 
 But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out 
 I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed 
 The brain was that fried egg, I might need 
 New direction was apparent 
 I was a child looking at the floor, staring 
 So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast 
 Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street 
 To make bread, never primary concern 
 Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn 
 I'd meet Muslims, gangsters, bitches, rastas 
 And macaroni niggas: imposters 
 So on a trip to New York on some beeswax 
 I get invited to a club where emcees at 
 And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head 
 Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with 
 Which I was rocking at the time 
 When I was going through them phases trying to find 
 Anything that seemed real in the world 
 Still searching, but I started liking this girl 
 Now, you know her as Erykah ""On & On"" Badu 
 Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you 
 Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed"" 
 The song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name 
 Were young, in love, in short we had fun 
 No regrets, no abortion, had a son 
 By the name of Seven 
 And he's five; by the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six 
 You do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts 
 Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts 
 To poke you in the heart and take you from the start 
 To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card 
 Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' 
 Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she smart 
 Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor 
 And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard 
 You fix it up, you trick it out 
 You give it rims, you give it bump 
 You give it all your time because that's all you can think about 
 And that's as far as I got 
  
 ""And that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go, knowing, the whole summer, that's all you could think about. Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up, you need a jump, like you need and you want to grow, and you change all the time. So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer-the next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more. You wanted something bigger and better."" 
 ""So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?"" 
 ""Right... right, so now you want a Cadillac..."""

 You know a lot of these bitches need an antibiotic 
 Moxacillin, Penicillin, something with a slin' in it 
 They want a sugar daddy, they want a man on a fixed income 
 They want man where they can come over to the old mans house 
 And go in the back porch and get $30 or $40 every here and there 
 And get in they honda and ride on off"

 Kickin up dust is a must 
 I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform 
 Stick a nigga like a unicorn 
 Vaugn, wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul 
 Cut his fuckin throat and I smile  
 Go to Simi Valley and surely 
 somebody knows the address of the jury 
 Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?"" (Who is Ice Cube?) 
 ""Can I talk to the grand wizard?"" then boom 
 Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral 
 Now he's zipped up like leather tuscadero 
 Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Coon 
 Shoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom

 ya story bore me 
 Taerin up shit with fire, shooters, looters 
 Now I got a lap-top computer 
 I told you all what happened and you heard it, read it 
 but all you could call me was anti-Semitic 
 Regret it-nope, said it-yep 
 Listen to my big black boots as I step 
 Niggas had to break you off somethin, give Bush a push 
 But your National Guard ain't hard 
 You had to get Rodney to stop me cos you know what? 
 We woulda teared this muthafucka up 
  
 Huh, make it rough! 
 Huh Muggs, make it rough!  
 
  
 It's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk 
 Now I'm stealin blunts 
 And it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker 
 Don't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers 
 Steal, muthafuck Fire Marshall Bill 
 Oh what the hell, throw the cocktail 
 I smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out 
 My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out 
 In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas 
 Oh Jesus, I ?? Surplus got the heaters 
 Meet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots 
 Got the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot 
 Ready for Darryl and like Beretta wouldn't say 
 Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow 
 Don't do the crime if you can't do the time 
 But I'm rollin so that's a fucked up slogan 
 The Hogan's Heroes spotted the gorilla by the Sizzler 
 Hittin up police killer 
 The super duper nigga that'll buck 
 We had to tear this muthafucka up so what the fuck!?!

 Huh, make it rough

"Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior 
 I never felt the feeling of euphoria 
 Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong 
 Wake up in the morning and I gotta win 
 Not taking the victory, that's my only sin 
 And so I send a message to your messenger 
 A warning shot to let em know I'm serious 
 I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window 
 The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you 
 On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks 
 I can crack every code you deliver, I attack 
 Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod 
 Even if you try hard, he can still die hard 
 Run but you can't hide: white flags 
 You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye 
  
 I will, I will climb the highest mountain 
 Before the flood comes 
 And all my fight is drowning in blood 
 What I got to lose? What I got to prove? 
 I guess war is my love 
  
 Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing 
 You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it 
 'Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out 
 And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6 
 I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick 
 I lead the pack, I follow no rules 
 I see the traps, I know you're close to 
 Falling on your face, unload, reload 
 Hand me another case, explode, explode 
 The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise 
 I know you hope your help is close by 
  
 I will, I will climb the highest mountain 
 Before the flood comes 
 And all my fight is drowning in blood 
 What I got to lose? What I got to prove? 
 I guess war is my love"

 Women pose, from timberland's to feminine clothes 
 Check there portfolios and put'em in centerfolds 
 Pen explode, draw crowds respond re-el 
 I stay calm as hell surrounded by bombshells 
 Careful as I get near'em, stand near and compare'em 
 Or all girl heirem, I'm the man with the serum

 The livest one representing BK to the fullest 
 Bastards ducking when Hov be bucking 
 Chicken-heads be clucking 
  
 Uh, back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen 
 And Jam Master Jay was alive I-I, I was mixing 
 Cooking coke in the kitchen 
 Back when Rodman was a Piston 
 Mike was losing to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one 
 Gave birth to my verbal imagination 
 Assume a virtue if you have not 
 Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet 
 ""Lord, we know who we are 
 Yet we know not what we may be"" 
 So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy 
 I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand 
 Back when Pam was on Martin 
 Yeah, that's where it all started 
 When Denzel was blotting carpet, I'll pack a... nine millimeter 
 When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa"" 
 When Lisa Bonet was Beyonce of her day, I had divas, y'all 
 Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah 
 Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts 
 There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort 
 Marcy me 
  
 Marcy me 
 Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence 
 I'm the Gotham City heartbeat 
 I, started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis 
 I'ma, Sufi to goofies, I could probably speak Farsi 
 That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past 
 Came through the bushes smelling like roses 
 I need a trophy just for that 
 Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof 
 Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talking busting off the roof, uh 
 Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke 
 Y'all flirting with death, I be winking through the scope 
 Shout out to all the murderers turned murals 
 Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau 
 Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle 
 All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile 
 Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes 
 Thus concluding my concerto 
 Marcy me 
  
 Must be in the air 
 Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know 
 Just the way I'm raised 
 I know, I know, I know 
 Oh Marcy, Marcy me 
 Just the way I am always gonna be 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 I ain't gonna change, no 
 Couldn't change me if I wanted to 
 You couldn't change me if you wanted to 
 I'ma take this with me to the Moon

"Where's my snare? 
 I have no snare in my headphones. There you go 
 Yeah... yo, yo 
  
 Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? 
 I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against 
 Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times 
 Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind 
 All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding 
 Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going 
 Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing 
 Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening 
 Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth 
 See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out 
 Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? 
 I'mma make you look so ridiculous now 
  
 I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry; but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) 
 I said I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet 
  
 Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet 
 And I don't know if no one knows it 
 So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
 I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 
 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD 
 I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months 
 My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 
 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
 No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die 
 I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side 
 Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try 
 To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake 
 I maybe made some mistakes 
 But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today 
 What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
 But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 
 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both 
 It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show"" 
  
 I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry; but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) 
 I said I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet 
  
 Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
 Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing 
 But put yourself in my position; just try to envision 
 Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen 
 Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing 
 Going through public housing systems, victim of MÃ¼nchausen's Syndrome 
 My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 
 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach 
 Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? 
 So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? 
 But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely 
 And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony 
 And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful 
 But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! 
 See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong 
 Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! 
 But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get 
 You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit 
 Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
 Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! 
  
 I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry; but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) 
 I said I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet 
  
 I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry; but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) 
 I said I'm sorry mama! 
 I never meant to hurt you! 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 I'm cleaning out my closet"

 Pride is the Devil 
 Think it got a hold on me 
 Pride is the Devil 
 It left so many R.I.P. 
 Pride is the Devil 
 Think it got a hold on me 
 Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh 
  
 Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void 
 And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh 
 Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void 
 And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah 
  
 Bright lights pass me in the city, it's emergency 
 I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me 
 Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me 
 I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency 
 Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be 
 Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities 
 Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty 
 Pride make a nigga feel the way that you would follow me 
 Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery 
 Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be 
 Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy 
 Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery 
 Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy 
 Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies 
 Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be 
 It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me 
  
 Pride is the Devil, uh 
 I think it got a hold on me 
 Pride is the Devil, uh 
 It left so many R.I.P. 
 Pride is the Devil 
 I think it got a hold on me

 Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void 
 And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah 
  
 Too much money to count, what's the amount? 
 Check never bounce 
 I gotta pay a nigga to add it up 
 Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up 
 Got racks on racks, I'm rackin' up, stackin' up 
 You're reachin', I'm actin' up  
 
 Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up 
 Making five a month, that's regular 
 Nigga playing with us, that's a negative 
 Go back to start, that's never 
 I'm a boss, my closet leather 
 Ain't no off-days on my schedule 
 Long as I live, we live forever 
 Told my twin this shit get better 
 These niggas done slipped, let me ahead 'em 
 Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet 
 I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next 
 Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette 
 I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet 
 All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich 
 I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense 
 I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture 
 I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it 
 Will I be destroyed? 
 Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying 
 I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it 
 All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it 
 I'll be crazy if I blow it  
 
 Pride is the Devil, uh 
 I think it got a hold on me

"I guess you could consider it poetry, but with me it started out with just words, just words. 
 They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases. 
 By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals, psychopathical killer 
  
 (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer 
 I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer 
 A psychopath, I'm a killer 
 A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
  
 Feelin' it in the air, hanging in the night 
 Staring at the full moon 
 Did you ever think we would come to find? 
 Maybe in my dreams 
  
 I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain 
 Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about 
 Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in the class 
 Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass 
 With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off 
 Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot 
 To my inner enemy in a rush 
 I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams 
 With anything less than a full bank 
 It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun 
 I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank 
 The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't 
 Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard 
 Every award show, we don't even get considered 
 How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical 
 To a kid that wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him? 
 Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit 
 Before me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit 
 We put the world onto us so watch how you say ""fuck me"" 
 You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it 
 Cause I was in 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time 
 I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity 
 And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer 
  
 (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Cause ain't nobody iller 
 Knowing nobody for realer 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
  
 This elite drinker, is a ringleader 
 I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher 
 With a street sweeper full of heat seekers 
 In your Jeep speakers I'm a keep ringers 
 I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver 
 Welcome to the slaughterhouse 
 Niggas try to tell me I spell too much 
 Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R 
 Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word 
 Making work disappear quick as magic 
 Abracadabra, the traffic blacker than Africa 
 Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood? 
 Money like Dracula, has him a spatula, ask me a question 
 Am I the best with the flexing? 
 Fuck yes with the goon talk 
 I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street 
 CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller 
 I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer 
  
 (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Cause ain't nobody iller 
 Knowing nobody for realer 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
  
 Feelin' it in the air, hanging in the night 
 Staring at the full moon 
 Did you ever think we would come to find? 
 Maybe in my dreams 
  
 The thought of retiring 
 Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron 
 What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'? 
 I'm hopin' to fill up your opening 
 Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements 
 First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and 
 You've probably already been with all the slaughter and iron men 
 No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin 
 With no strings attached 
 I'm just the product of a hostile environment 
 But bein' brought up so brought up inspired 
 But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool 
 Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme 
 And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance 
 Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath 
 Obscene talkin', the twine like a bean's talkin' and buyin' 
 But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right 
 But everything I write seems wrong and it's like 
 I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause 
 In the fabric of our modern society 
 Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans 
 Dammit the pope's mad again 
 Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin 
 Singin' ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" again 
 In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in, a glad bag 
 Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance, like that again 
 You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again? 
 I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've thought of another fucking line 
 Forgive me father, for I have sinned 
 But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak 
 Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet 
 Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant 
 After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin' to sneak by it 
 While his feet stomp follow me while I revive rap 
 I'm a start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it 
 You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in 
 Boston, across the marathon finish line and I 
 Put your thoughts against mine 
 Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar 
 And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire 
 Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife 
 A saberless Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight 
 With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up 
 I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie 
 Perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end 
 Like fuck 'em all and just ride 
 Like I'm locked up inside a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car 
 Uncle Ronnie is driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door 
 Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room 
  
 (I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose 
 (A psychopath, I'm a killer) 
 Cause ain't nobody iller 
 Knowing nobody for realer

"Some days I just wanna up and call it quits 
 I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks 
 Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits 
 My life's like one great big ball of shit! 
  
 If I could just put it all into all I spit 
 Instead of always trying swallow it 
 Instead of starin' at this wall and shit 
 While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit 
 Can't call it shit! 
  
 All I know is I'm about to hit the wall 
 If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits 
 This is it, last straw 
 That's all, that's it 
 I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic 
  
 I'm like a skillet bubblin', until it filters up 
 I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up 
 Blow this building up, I've been sealed enough 
 My cup runneth over, I done filled it up 
  
 The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts! 
 You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts 
 Well, Imma show you what, you gon' feel my rush 
 If you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch 
  
 Peel the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up 
 Goosebumps, yeah Imma make your hair sit up, yeah sit up 
 Imma tell you who I be, Imma make you hate me, cause you ain't me 
  
 You wait, it ain't too late to finally see 
 What you close-minded fucks were too blind to see 
 Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee 
 Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me 
  
 You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine 
 All I need's a line, but sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme 
 To express how I'm really feeling at that time, yes 
 Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
  
 It's just sometimes it's always me 
 How dark can these hallways be 
 The clock strikes midnight 
 1, 2, then half past 3 
 This half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece of paper 
  
 I'm desperate at my desk 
 If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest, again 
 Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothing 
 Fuck, I'm stumped, oh, wait, here comes something, nope! 
  
 It's not good enough, scribble it out 
 New pad, crinkle it up, and throw this shit out 
 I'm fizzling out, thought I figured it out 
 Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out 
  
 I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave 
 To this Trade ? Cyanide I spit to the grave 
 Real enough to rile you up, want me to flip it? I can rip it 
 Any style you want 
  
 Imma switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter 
 Imma sit here till I get enough of me to finally hit a fucking boiling point 
 Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin, bitch come get destroyed 
  
 An MC's worst dream, I make them tensed, they hate me 
 See me and shake like a chain-link fence 
 By the looks of 'em you would swear that Jaws was coming 
 By the screams of 'em you would swear I'm sawing someone 
  
 By the way they runnin', you would swear the law was coming 
 It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothing 
 Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back 
 He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest 
  
 I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock 
 Fuck this clock! Imma make them eat this watch 
 Don't believe me watch! Imma win this race 
 And Imma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch! 
  
 I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice 
 'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice 
 If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung 
 If I have half a chance, I'll grab it, rabbit run!"
"Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh 
 Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South? 
 One time 
  
 Lord forgive me, for I've sinned 
 Over and over again just to stay on top 
 I recall memories, filled with sin 
 Over and over again 
 And again and again and again 
  
 When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team 
 See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme 
 For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller 
 See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer 
 Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh 
 His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit 
 The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted 
 Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500 
 As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack 
 I used to idolize Cat 
 Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap 
 How he go out like that? 
 Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching 
 I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR 
 Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3 
 Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis 
 From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised 
 Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies 
 Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect 
 Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks 
 Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks 
  
 Lord forgive me, for I've sinned 
 Over and over again just to stay on top 
 I recall memories, filled with sin 
 Over and over again 
 And again and again and again 
  
 That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on 
 Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran 
 I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe 
 And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose 
 Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning 
 Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning 
 Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar 
 Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah 
 Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing 
 Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason 
 A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth 
 Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth 
 I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall 
 Together niggas stand and divided they fall 
 Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion 
 Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean 
 Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold 
 Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior 
 Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious 
 Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money 
 Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian 
 Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion 
  
 Lord forgive me, for I've sinned 
 Over and over again just to stay on top 
 I recall memories, filled with sin 
 Over and over again 
 And again and again and again 
  
 Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo 
 The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo 
 Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy 
 Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley 
 Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit 
 A lot a niggas flow the way I flow 
 But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know 
 Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel 
 If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail 
 Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused 
 And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose 
 I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance 
 Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags 
 In a conversation over shrimp and lobster 
 At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners 
 Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will 
 If the flow don't kill you the MAC will 
  
 Lord forgive me, for I've sinned 
 Over and over again just to stay on top 
 I recall memories, filled with sin 
 Over and over again 
 And again and again and again"

 Tech, when have you ever known me not to flash on you like that? 
 You feel like that's cool? You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Why you gotta sample a nigga like that though? 
 Man, that's what the fuck I do  
 
 Why? I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do 
 You actin' a whole girl, no, girl, don't know what you be going through 
 Question mark this, what's the matter with you? It's like it's a habit with you 
 If I ask you don't call, don't text, I can't take that PMS shit"
"Whoo, turn me up, don't turn me down 
 Cut me up, don't let me down, find, find a way 
  
 Find a way to get out, without a hit out 
 You dig in, you dig out, you get out 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick 
 Find a way to get in, to fit in 
 You get on, you get out, without a doubt 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick 
  
 Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole) 
 With a frown on my face 
 (In the place to be) In the place to be 
 And not to be at the same time 
  
 G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down 
 O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round 
 If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down 
 Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us 
  
 Find a way to get out, without a hit out 
 You dig in, you dig out, you get out 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick 
 Find a way to get in, to fit in 
 You get on, you get out, without a doubt 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick  
 
 I just want you to know how I feel 
 Feeling good, feeling great 
 How I feel 
 Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you? 
 I just want you to know how I feel 
 Feeling good, feeling great 
 How I feel 
 Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?  
 
 Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony 
 As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me 
 How to be the smooth operator, dominator 
 In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer 
 Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer 
 He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia 
 A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique 
 Sweat me, wipe off the sweat 
 Fight off the shit and flush the waste down 
 The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground 
 Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this 
 Planet's standards trust and the purpose 
 Campaign in vain for the same lame fame 
 You've obtained, you ought to be detained 
 By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility 
 Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me 
 And my ears, and my peers 
 I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear 
 Then reappear again in a fresh new light 
 I hope it's peaceful and cloudy 
 'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like  
 
 G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down 
 O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round 
 If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down 
 Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us 
  
 Find a way to get out, without a hit out 
 You dig in, you dig out, you get out 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick 
 Find a way to get in, to fit in 
 You get on, you get out without a doubt 
 Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick  
 
 I just want you to know how I feel 
 Feeling good, feeling great 
 How I feel 
 Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you? 
 I just want you to know how I feel 
 Feeling good, feeling great 
 How I feel 
 Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?"
"Picture me 
 In a casket 
 Blasted 
 Never nobody 
 Knew how long 
 The pain lasted 
 Keep my eyes tight 
 I'm frightened 
 But I fights like Tyson 
 When playin' this game of life 
 I'm losing 
 Longing to be enlightened 
 Absorb my mind state 
 Reduce the crime rate 
 And take me out 
 When running toward the Lord 
 I see 'em fake me 
 Out shook me 
 So from church I play hookie 
 Listen to the words of a brother 
 The sick stutters 
 So you better better 
 Get the get the bags ready 
 Comes a killer killer 
 Like Skagnetti 
 My brains contaminated 
 Hella rotten 
 Wasn't me that killed you 
 Who was it what was it 
 The effects of the mildew 
 My brain's wilted 
 In my eyes the world is a bit tilted 
 Lord take me away 
 Before somebody else gets killed 
 Blood spilled 
 Seriously 
 This is the letter to my homies 
 I'll be missin' 
 God told me to behold a pale horse 
 But I didn't listen 
 It's hard man 
 My life is scarred man 
 I'm losing my mind 
 So now it's time 
 Sincerely sign 
 N9NE  
 
  
 I just wanna die 
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way that I feel 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way it has to be  
 
   
 
 I made your life a living hell 
 With my infidelity 
 Remember your telling me 
 All I give a damn about 
 Is weed stems and melodies 
 Remember you 
 Spent 30 minutes in the hospital parking lot 
 Crying 
 When the blood test read 
 The baby of another woman was mine 
 99.99 
 You should've left 
 Along time ago like Mary J. say 
 Just let it go like Ray J. 
 Con't 
 I know your mamma heard 
 You yelling mayday 
 Spent my life trying to R-A to the P 
 You sick of me 
 Always bein' B to the R-O-K to the E 
 Now there's nothin' 
 Else left of me 
 I was a bum 
 But you still wanted some 
 Through the rain, snow and thunder 
 Foul ups , bleeps and blunders 
 But no man shall tear asunder 
 Is what you said 
 You should've put multi bullets 
 In my head 
 When you found that evil 
 Instinct was a song 
 Where the events actually went on 
 This is the letter 
 To my homie, my friend 
 Who put up with me for 8 
 So now to take me 
 Really quickly is my fate 
 I'm sorry 
 For making it hard 
 I know your scarred 
 I'm losing my mind 
 So now it's time 
 Sincerely sign 
 N9ne  
 
  
 I just want to die 
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way that I feel 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way it has to be  
 
   
 
 I love ya'll 
 The dynamic duo, my babies 
 It ain't your fault 
 That your daddy's crazy 
 Donny, 
 I miss your drumming like me 
 One day you'll be ruling 
 Leelee, 
 I miss you in my face 
 Yellin' 
 Daddy, what you doin' 
 You two are the reason 
 Why I'm still standing today 
 But I'm 1600 miles away 
 And you get my heart sinkin' 
 When I start thinkin' about you babies 
 I heavily start drinkin' 
 On a daily puffin' 
 I'm seeing my heart 
 I gots to toughin' 
 Can't see me leavin' my angels with nothin' 
 So I keep bussin' 
 Use my pain for you two 
 I've gotta come up in the game 
 So one day you can do the same with yours 
 Love you galore 
 And I ain't playin' 
 makin' me put an end 
 To this suicidal mind state sayin'  
 
  
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way I feel 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 I don't want to wake up 
 I don't wanna cuz 
 That's the way it has to be"

 Fresh dressed like a million bucks 
 Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks 
 I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend 
 Got some hoochies I'mma hook up with quarter to ten 
 My daughter with me and we came from the mall 
 Don't need no baby mama drama 
 Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off 
 I hit the car wash at half past four 
 Some kid was star struck 
 I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour 
 My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be 
 I went to the famous Project that they call QB 
 I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb 
 A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word 
 I turned the corner with my burner and palm 
 Niggas know my name and game I'm a murderous Don 
 Saw my peoples then extended my arm

 Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggas off 
 I've been around a couple of times, know how things go 
 I dealt with 'em all on different occasion 
 The same things'll come in different stages 
 So when them things rise up or pop up 
 I look right past as if it's weightless 
 Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process 
 So I can levitate to more important topics 
 Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes 
 20 Ls Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses 
 Dippin' in the twilight 
 With gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light 
 The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich

 Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, haters all fold 
 'Cause my 9 is aimed up, I left four seasons 
 My niggas bleedin' cause of four reasons 
 Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even 
 Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny with my comrade 
 Conversatin' on what we believe in 
 Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend 
 G's a week in the make freak knees bend 
 I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room 
 They nymphomaniacs probably lick homegirls womb 
 As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em and shit 
 They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip 
 Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police 
 But when I puffed and coughed 
 Seconds later screamin' ""Fuck the Law"" 
 Got CDs, TVs, guns tucked in the floor 
 Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more 
 So uh

"'Cause they're bragging, telling the fuckers in jail yo, we just got pumped woo 
 and that's why we don't do it, I know what I'm doing, imma destroy 'em 
  
 Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town 
 Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now 
 What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz? 
 Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz 
 Am I wrong? Niggaz makin songs, tryin to get with us 
 Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust 
 To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come 
 shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die 
 Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch! 
 I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie 
 THEN! We watch the other two die slow 
 Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow 
 BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes 
 I can't stand you hoes, uhh 
 Now label this my fuckin trick shot 
 My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop 
 When we RIDE 
  
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug 
 And still, we try to change the past, in vain 
 Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug 
 a man of military means in my artillery 
 Watchin over me through every murder scene 
  
 Come take a journey through my mind's eye 
 You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye 
 Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger 
 So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes 
 You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits 
 Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention 
 Here's a word to those that robbed me 
 I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me 
 Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell? 
 See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell 
 How many niggaz wanna be involved? 
 See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball 
 Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed 
 Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz 
 Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD 
 Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD 
  
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug 
 And still, we try to change the past, in vain 
 Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug 
 a man of military means in my artillery 
 Watchin over me through every murder scene 
  
 I really didn't believe until I got shot that no black person would shoot me. 
 I was their representative, they would never harm me 
  
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug 
 And still, we try to change the past, in vain 
 Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed 
 And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug 
 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug

 Tell me will my niggaz mourn me? 
 The death of a true thug

 Watchin over me through every murder scene"
"I miss the days when 
 I had a smile on my face and 
 Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things 
 Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone 
 And wasn't so cautious, and always exhausted 
 And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said 
 Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike 
 Not overthinkin' my life 
 Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person 
 Or someone that nobody likes 
 Not always stressin' 'bout money 
 Or losin' my job or scared I ain't makin' the flight 
 Not always going to bed every night 
 With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds 
  
 What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me? 
 When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it 
 And question my purpose to breath? 
 Wonderin' who I should be, happiness outta my reach 
 Scared to get back on my feet 
 Need to get rid of what's detrimental 
 But it's hard to let go 
 When the thing that hurt you helped you get to your dream 
 See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded 
 Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it 
 Just innocent, waitin', not always living in anguish 
 When did I break and become over taken? 
 What was the moment I caved and gave away all of my faith 
 And made a replacement? I miss the days when, I miss the days when 
  
 I miss the smiles we had when we were young 
 I miss the memories of feeling love 
 I miss us runnin' underneath the sun 
 Staring out the window when the rain would come 
 I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah 
 I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah 
 When we had joy and we were innocent 
 I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again 
  
 Gimme my mind back, yeah, gimme my mind back 
 The one that told me I was worth something when I fall flat, yeah fall flat 
 The one that told me I was worth something when I'm off track 
 Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage 
 And it was free to run fast 
 Yeah, gimme my mind back, gimme my-gimme my mind back 
 Before it was hi-jacked and wasn't described as 
 A place of limitation always indicating I can't 
 Handle everything from my past 
 Handed anything it dissects 
 Till I'm depressed, I know I'm blessed 
 But I'm cursed too 
  
 Take me back when, I was happy but I wasn't acting 
 Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kinda weakness 
 Or a thing that's unattractive 
 Had emotion but I learned to mask it 
 Didn't know what I was running after 
 Didn't know the older I would grow the more I lose control 
 And takin' all the baggage, it's really sad when 
 Everything you thought was stable crashes 
 Everything you thought would take the sadness 
 Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin' 
 Will we ever feel like we imagine? 
 Will we ever feel like we adapted? 
 Will we ever feel like we did back then? 
 Just take me back when, just take me back when 
  
 I miss the smiles we had when we were young 
 I miss the memories of feeling love 
 I miss us runnin' underneath the sun 
 Staring out the window when the rain would come 
 I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah 
 I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah 
 When we had joy and we were innocent 
 I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again 
  
 Yeah 
  
 Yeah 
 I miss the smiles we had when we were young 
 I miss the memories of feeling love 
 I miss us runnin' underneath the sun 
 Staring out the window when the rain would come 
 I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah 
 I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah 
 When we had joy and we were innocent 
 I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again"
"Up out of there 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin like that? 
 Ah shit, you done fucked up now 
 (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party) 
 You done put two of America's most wanted in the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time 
 (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party) 
 Y'all niggas about to feel this 
 (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party) 
 Break out the Champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms, have one on us, a'ight? 
 (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)  
 
 A toast to the gangsters  
 
 Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture 
 Bomb the hoochies with precision 
 My intention's to get richer 
 With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie 
 You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs  
 
 Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun 
 'Cause they got me on the run 
 Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome 
 ""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind 
 But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine 
 So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit 
 And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit  
 
 So now they got us laced 
 Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases 
 Bitches get ready for the throw down 
 The shit's about to go down 
 Me and Snoop about to clown 
 I'm losin' my religion 
 I'm vicious on these stool pigeons 
 You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin' 
 Niggas be actin' like they savage 
 They out to get the cabbage 
 I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish  
 
 I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina 
 I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino 
 And I think I've got a black Bimmer 
 But my dream's to own a fly casino 
 Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal 
 And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal 
 It feels good to you, baby-bubba 
 You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker  
 
 Now follow as we ride 
 Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side 
 And I can make you famous 
 Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us? 
 I live in fear of a felony 
 I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's 
 If you got it, better flaunt it 
 Another warrant for two of America's most wanted  
 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party  
 
 Now give me fifty feet 
 Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets 
 And keep whatever's left of me 
 Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is grief 
 Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me 
 I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what? 
 There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs 
 You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear 
 Bow down in the presence of a boss player  
 
 It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin' 
 Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin' 
 You gotta have papers in this world 
 You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl 
 You doin' your job every day 
 And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray 
 Let me tell you about life and about the way it is 
 You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids  
 
 They tell me not to roll with my glock 
 So now I got a throw-away 
 Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day 
 They wonder how I live with five shots 
 Niggas is hard to kill on my block 
 Schemes for currency and dough-related 
 Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it 
 No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it 
 My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted  
 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 (Nothin' but a gangsta party 
 It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party) 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party  
 
 Biatch! Where you at? Where you at? 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party 
 Yeah, Death Row"
"Uh-uh-uh, what up? 
 Uh, I'm tryna, what up? 
 Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something 
 Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up? 
 I say, what up? 
 Uh-uh, I'm tryna 
  
 Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry 
 Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie 
 Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride 
 Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe 
 Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song's 'bout a young boy 
 That's going wild inside, when my world collide 
 With your world where your girl and your kids reside 
 We kill the facades, we feel free to fly 
 We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky 
 I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new 
 If my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed 
 I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong 
 Insecurity roams the black community 
 Homes where kids must have jewelry 
 The high school female need earrings and details 
 So she can be cool to be amongst popularity 
 The various name brands that reached the price scan 
 It's not about the right price, but more like the right scam 
 To rule us all, confuse us all 
 Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw 
 Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain 
 And a Range that is not paid for 
 My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house 
 That lives around his neck like a white collar 
 So why fast forward? Then I rewind 
 A time machine can help me double back to slavery times 
 Picking cotton from a field that a white man own 
 The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home 
 Negro spiritual songs gave us some type of sanity 
 Before your vanity they parted our families 
 They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed 
 The more we were afraid, the more they made rules 
 And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague 
 Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh! 
 And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts 
 And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar 
 Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering 
 Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation 
 See what we facing is now coming back to the roots 
 Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot? 
 Call us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit 
 Of happiness, we're capturing these feelings in things that we do 
 Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to 
 A modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie 
 Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me 
 She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though 
 We filling up the gas for Rollies 
 Upgrade to twenty-sixes after riding Kobes 
 My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya 
 He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors 
 So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw 
 The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss 
 Slaves 
  
 Uh, I said the four-hundred years we never had nothing 
 Barely had clothes on our back 
 It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change 
 We over-exaggerate on our living expenses 
 So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger 
 Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it 
 And on the back of the window it says ""Get on my level, hoe."" 
 You're a vanity slave 
 We're all vanity slaves 
 And with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at? 
 I'm not from around here 
 Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho? 
 Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month 
 Let them checks coming nigga 
 I'm tryna get some, but what up?"
"(Photoshoot!) 
 You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months 
 It's too loud 
 Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them 
 Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot 
 It's too loud 
 Three's not a crowd all up in it, slow fire 
  
 Don't fall on my face 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate 
 Don't fall on my 
  
 Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race 
 Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace 
 Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre 
 In that first marijuana tape-guess I got a chronic case (yeah) 
 And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face 
 I know this time Paul and Dre 
 They won't tell me what not to say (nope) 
 And though me and my party days 
 Have all pretty much parted ways 
 You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" 
 One last time for Charlamagne 
 If my response is late, it's just how long it takes 
 To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away 
 These rappers are like Hunger Games 
 One minute, they're mockin' Jay 
 Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake 
 Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away 
 But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate 
 I've had as much as I can tolerate 
 I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience 
 I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once 
 You wanted Shady? You got him! 
  
 Don't fall on my face (yeah) 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh 
 Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!) 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!) 
 Don't fall on my fate (look) 
  
 Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it 
 Or have his body bag get zipped 
 The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!) 
 And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks 
 Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted 
 Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly 
 Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot 
 Lackin' with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"" 
 Ho, you better go back and listen 
 You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up 
 Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup 
 Hopin' that you rappers fall in that 
 Dre said, ""Hold your head up!""-Kathy Griffin 
 Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition 
 This is how I shot ahead (pew)-Gabby Gifford 
 My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business 
 Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a (faggot), bitch 
 It's not just 'cause you lack attention 
 It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious 
 If you're gonna critique me 
 You better at least be as good or better 
 Get Earl the Hooded Sweater 
 Whatever his name is to help you put together 
 Some words, more than just two letters 
 The fans waited for this moment like that feature 
 When I stole the show (ha), sorry if I took forever (haha) 
  
 Don't fall on my face (yeah) 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't) 
 Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!) 
 Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha) 
 Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy) 
  
 Just remember, I was here before you 
 And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you 
 Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew 
 Just what the doctor ordered 
 Revenge is the best medicine 
 Increase the dose, from least to most 
 And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves 
 They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches 
 So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show 
 Every parasite needs a host (haha) 
 Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of 
 All I know is I wrote every single word of 
 Everything I ever murdered 
 Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah) 
 And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts 
 When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer 
 A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air 
 Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror 
 That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care 
 But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket 
 How I'm buryin' these artists 
 On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus' 
 Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly' 
 And what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo) 
 And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone 
 Or I'll show you an Elvis clone 
 Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone 
 Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote 
 Put my feet up and just make myself at home 
 I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture 
 I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the 
 Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh 
 Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan 
 But I'm not gonna fall... bitch! 
  
 It's too loud 
 Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot 
 It's too loud 
 Three's not a crowd all up in it 
 Slow fire"

"Gotta try to stay above water, y'know? 
 Just stay busy, stay working 
 Puff told me, like, the key to this joint 
 The key to staying on top of things 
 Is treat everything like it's your first project, no m saying? 
 Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern 
 Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry 
  
 Y'all wanna know why he don't stop? 
 Y'all wanna know why he don't flop? 
 Let me tell you pe-people why 
 Came from the bottom of the block I 
 When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit 
 Had to pull the opposite out this bitch 
 Had to get my ride on 
 Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to 
 Had to had to get these chips 
 Had to make moves like Olajuwon 
 Started out selling dimes and nicks 
 Graduated to a brick 
 No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip 
 Legendary like a schoolboy 
 Crushing merely nearly every every chick 
 Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped 
 And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I 
 On some Trugoy shit 
 Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return 
 Had to play with fire and get burned 
 Only way the boy ever gon' learn 
 Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn 
 Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned 
  
 It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle 
 The songs that I sing to you is my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst is the same as when I came 
 It's my joy and my tears 
 And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything 
  
 Like I never rode in a limo 
 Like I just dropped flows to a demo 
 Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental 
 Back in the Stu' again 
 No prob' living was a whole lot simple 
 When you think back, you thought that 
 You would never make it this far 
 Then you take advantage of the luck you handed 
 Or the talent you been given 
 Ain't no half stepping, ain't no, no slipping 
 Ain't no different from a block that's hitting 
 Gotta get it while the getting's good 
 Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop 
 Then you gotta bid it, good riddance 
 Goodbye! This is my second major breakup 
 My first was with a pager 
 With a hooptie, a cook pot and the game 
 This one's with the stew, with the stage, with the fortune 
 Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the fame 
  
 It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle 
 The songs that I sing to you is my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst is the same as when I came 
 It's my joy and my tears 
 And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything 
 Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first 
 And my thirst like the first song I sang 
  
 Woo, it's like the blues, we gon' ride out on this one

 Yo High, remember you was making them baskets

 Your accounting was crazy wrong and shit 
 But we still put it together 
 Biggs, whass up? 
 Member we went to St. Thomas and uh (John Meneilly)

 At his crib, I think that was Rudy 
 And they was having a little trouble with the pool 
 You and Ty-Ty was laughing 
 Emory was there; what up, Emory? 
 What up, Ty? Hip-Hop, what up, man? 
 Aye, aye Hop, you ain't, you ain't have no uh

 That's what I'm talking 'bout right there, homie 
 Gee, what up, Gee? 
 Yes sir, everybody in the Roc 
 Hey, Guru, I know you spoiled, man

 Biggie Smalls, rest in peace 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

 Slugging you, that's what a thug will do

 The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections 
 They come home, get a nine, then commit crime to perfection 
 It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics

 Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid 
 In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid 
 You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid 
 Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid 
 Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in 
 Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s 
 Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins 
 Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again 
 The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous 
 But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends 
 That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out 
 I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out? 
 It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park 
 Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark 
 He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up 
 Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block 
 Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop 
 'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops 
 CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props 
 If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

 Yeah, I'm as ill as can be 
 My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me 
 Killing so villainously 
 Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers 
 You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us 
 And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers  
 
 It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires 
 Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead 
 He must ain't know, but now we know how Shady the Math is 
 Even murderous tactics get better with practice 
 Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn 
 School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn  
 
 Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn 
 I'm debating mutilating the lady 
 You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby 
 There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer 
 I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her 
 Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her 
 Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her 
 And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub  
 
 When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up 
 The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up 
 In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous 
 Look deep in my eye, see many many men die 
 I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

 Only the light's lime, and my mic's on

 I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (For sure)

 For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch) 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' (Ha-ha) 
 Hold you through the night (Ha-ha, right) 
 I just wanna love ya (We wanna love alcohol) 
 For the rest of my life (We wanna love guns) 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' (We wanna love money, ha) 
 Hold you through the night (We don't wanna love no bitches, though) 
  
 There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice, that's sorta unique 
 'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep 
 And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat 
 You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep 
 I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap 
 I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped 
 I bully these rappers so bad lyrically 
 It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money 
 You can't pay me enough for you to play me, it's cockamanie 
 You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady 
 My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo 
 I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit and caboodle 
 I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero uno 
 Assume it, there's no humor in it no more, you know 
 I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag 
 You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass 
 You better love me, bitch 
  
 I just wanna love ya 
 For the rest of my life 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' 
 Hold you through the night (And all the bitches say) 
 I just wanna love ya 
 For the rest of my life 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' 
 Hold you through the night 
  
 My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name 
 If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain (Yeah!) 
 If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss 
 911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce (Woo!) 
 I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit (Huh-uh) 
 Let me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch 
 Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape 
 Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape 
 I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes 
 I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose (God-damn!) 
 I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet 
 Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats (Huh-uh) 
 That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail 
 That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell 
 My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes 
 And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah) 
  
 I just wanna love ya 
 For the rest of my life (I love the burners, the money) 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' (The bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha-ha-ha) 
 Hold you through the night 
 I just wanna love ya 
 For the rest of my life 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin' (I just wanna love you) 
 Hold you through the night (Yeah!)"
"Uh, right, oh, oh 
 Right (Yeah), one-two, one-two, ay  
 
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well 
 (Yeah, uh, yeah) 
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25 (Five) 
 She turned around and looked at me and said ""Alive"" 
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well 
 (Uh, oh)  
 
 Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right) 
 Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right) 
 Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh) 
 Work pots and pans (Goddammit), just to cop me some Airs 
 My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ay) 
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move 
 My nephew gone, my heart is torn 
 Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born 
 My faith in God, every day is hard 
 Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard  
 
 Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God 
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all 
 So que serÃ¡ (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah 
 Let it chase the pain, 'fore it goes too far  
 
 Yeah, my dreams is big, reality set in (Huh) 
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah) 
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas 
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it 
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise 
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo) 
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin' 
 I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah) 
 Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while 
 Momma, look at ya son, what happened to my smile? 
 My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket 
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it 
 Champagne for the pain, weed for the low 
 Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go? 
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment 
 I look in the mirror, my only opponent 
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres? 
 Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed 
 No crying in public, just lying to judges 
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well  
 
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well 
 Goddammit"
"Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo 
 Live from the graveyard 
 I don't wanna be your man, bitch, (fuck that) what you crazy 
 I don't wanna be your fuckin' man 
 You stupid you fuckin' idiot (drunk ho) 
 I wanna be 
 Yo let me fuck that nigga down 
 What's that? 
 Ay yo what you doin' with that big ass 
 My ghetto love song (hahaha) 
 Set it off, set it off 
 Let's be friends 
 Where my niggas at 
 Where my niggas, where my niggas 
 Where my niggas at, all my real niggas (throw your muthafuckin' hands up) 
 Where my niggas, where my niggas 
 Hahahaha yeah (lets go lets go) 
 Let's be friends (throw ya hands in the air) 
 There's no need to front (let's see ya just throw ya hands in the air) 
 Let's be friends... 
 (Westside in this motherfucker right here, Westside) 
 (throw ya hands in the air)  
 
 Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted 
 As you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented 
 What's the haps, baby? Come get with me and perhaps, lady 
 You can help me multiply my stacks, baby 
 Currency seems small, I need companionship 
 Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit 
 So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink? 
 Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink 
 This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches 
 Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches 
 Check my resume, sippin' on Cristal and Alize 
 Smokin' on big weed, keyed the Cali way 
 Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fifth 
 I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch 
 Let my pedigree, read briefly, they're so cheap 
 Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief 
 Mash on my so-called cum, who the man? 
 While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head 
 Understand this: Ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay Z! 
 He broke and I smoke daily, baby, let's be friends  
 
 Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? C'mon!) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends 
 (All my niggas, where my hoes at?) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? 
 Let's be friends! (Where the bitches at? 
 Where the niggas with money? Where you at, baby?) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends  
 
 I met you and I stuttered in passion 
 Though slightly blinded by that ass 
 It was hard to keep my dick in my pants 
 Every time you pass got me checkin' for you 
 Hardcore, starin' and watchin' 
 Me and you, one on one, picture countless options 
 Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me 
 Erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics 
 Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch 
 everything inside you from my head to my nuts 
 You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine 
 Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind 
 Back in time, I recall how she used to be 
 I guess money and fame made you used to me 
 What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag 
 Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass! 
 Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen 
 Got my hands on your thighs 
 Now let me in between as friends  
 
 Let's be friends (Westside, motherfucker, right here) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends 
 (Westside in this motherfucker) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? 
 Let's be friends (Westside in this motherfucker right here) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends 
 (In this motherfucker right here) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends  
 
 Can you imagine me in player mode? Rush the tricks 
 I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch 
 Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game? 
 Bet I scream ""Westside!"" when I came (Westside!) 
 Scream my name 'cause, baby, it's delicious 
 Ghetto weak spot for pretty bitches up and down 
 Similar to switches 
 My movement, baby, let your back  it 
 Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it 
 You got me high, let me come inside! 
 I love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride! 
 Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch? 
 Fuck player hatin' niggas, 'cause they cockblock 
 You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game? 
 Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change? 
 Made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed 
 A bad seed turned good, in this world of G's 
 Baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked 
 It's the fuck song, so check my record, and let's be friends 
 Where my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at? 
 Where my bitches at? Thug style!  
 
 Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?) 
 (Throw yo' guns in the air!) 
 Friends... (My ghetto love song! 
 It goes on and on and on and on) 
 Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?) 
 (Where my niggas at?) 
 Friends... (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?) 
 (Where my people at? Let's be...)  
 
 Where my people at? Show me where my people at! 
 Where my people at? Show me where my people at! 
 All my niggas now, just my niggas come! 
 Where my niggas at? Just my niggas now! 
 Be friends, tell me where my niggas at 
 Be friends, tell me where my bitches at 
 Be friends, tell me where my people at 
 Be friends, tell me where my bitches at 
 Make money, take money, be friends  
 
 Let's be friends (Get your cash on! Let's get dough!) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends 
 (C'mon, get your cash on!) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? 
 Let's be friends (C'mon, get your cash on! Let's get paid!) 
 You ain't gotta be my man at all 
 Long as you just bring me your friends 
 (C'mon, get your cash on!) 
 Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends  
 
 Make money, take money! 
 Make money, take money! 
 Make money, take money! 
 Make money, take money! 
 Make money, take money!"
"In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter 
 My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up 
 An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis 
 Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis 
 Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded 
 Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache 
 I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted 
 There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it 
 So, quick-this dynamite stick, bury the wick 
 It's gonna explode any minute 
 Some lunatic lit it 
 And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling 
 When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling! 
 I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready 
 'Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's potbelly 
 This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running 
 So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening 
  
 No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry 
 You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me 
 No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me 
 No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me 
 Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all 
 'Til I get a call that God's coming 
 No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny 
 I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me 
 No apologies! 
  
 My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow 
 I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows 
 But these cellos help just to keep me mellow 
 Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows 
 I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over 
 These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me 
 I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough 
 So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs 
 I choke mics like asphyxiation 
 When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha! 
 Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case 
 And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted 
 'Til my assassination 
 'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation 
 .44 mag's a fascination 
 A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then- 
  
 No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry 
 You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me 
 No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me 
 No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me 
 Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all 
 'Til I get a call that God's coming 
 No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny 
 I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me 
 No apologies! 
  
 This song isn't for you, it's for me 
 A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see 
 If he still has it and if his skills mastered 
 He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a- 
 Real MC, got you feelin' me 
 Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree 
 As long as there's still this hunger and will in me 
 Then expect a longer life expectancy 
 I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this 
 Outlet to salvage me inside 
 I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing 
 And mourning, so I'm warning you: don't coax me 
 It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing 
 Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be- 
 Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing 
 It's stupid, they don't know, 'cause they don't see 
 That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it 
 I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did 
 That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking 
 They can suck my dick while I'm puking 
 And you, too, you can- 
  
 Expect no sympathy from me 
 I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be 
 Cold as a G, my heart's frozen 
 It don't even beat, so expect no apologies 
 Expect no sympathy from me 
 I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be 
 Cold as a G, my heart's frozen 
 It don't even beat, so expect no apologies"

 Underrated, long awaited, everybody knew me when I made it 
 They debated, couldn't fade it, niggas even tried to imitate it 
 Do you really wanna make Nina hit you with one of these killer flows? 
 Everybody know I got the kinda scripts that'll make a demon catch a cold 
 Got the money, got the power, 6 hooks wet up in the shower 
 With the cleaner, Tecca Nina, cold when I'm bustin' at the cowards 
 When I finish droppin' this freeze out send 'em to the necropolis 
 Hail to the poppinest with the villains mobbin' is marvelous 
 When me lay me head in Les Miserables (Killa) 
 With the backwards tihs I be the God (Zilla)

 Servants in the back keep bringin' me spoo d's with 151 
 Hella choices of women, take 'em to the room, drop the semen 
 Have the little one show 'em how to power bomb demons 
 My flow'll find the temper in you, whimper in you 
 I'm too cold so don't even bother takin' my temperature, nigga

 Good and bad minions in the middle me and Satan's dichotomy obviously 
 Nonsmalable cromda lyricombolus, psych!

 That Tech N9ne be the strangest 
 Mr. Freezmizer before the fatality let finish 
 My slushy like Budweiser you an appetizer 
 Flowin' off yellin' with a passion, blastin' no time to ration 
 Everlastin' cashin' a vast stash colder then aspen askin'

 Were the competition leavin' all the women soaked like 
 On a mission to get the punanny wet then it freezes

 I kicks ass for the cash and I get it, get it 
 Ain't nobody on the planet fuckin' with it, with it 
 I heard you bust that weak ass flow when you did it need to quit it

 I wear my sunglasses at night all haters don't understand (What's that?) 
 Cause when my gun blasts it's bright cause I can, cause I can (That's right)

"Sorry boys 
 But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again 
 Lay down, lay down 
 Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy 
 Always knew I'd make a stop there 
 But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought 
 The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last 
 Bleek's gonna be a good rapper 
 New, improved Jay-Z I quit 
 I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around 
 Sorry Big, I tried, honest 
 Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots 
 The bar's closing, where we going to for breakfast? 
 Roc-A-Fella y'all OK, I'm reloaded! 
  
 ""Bringing the drama"" 
 ""Trying to come up in the game"" ""Marcy"" 
 ""Add a couple of dollar signs to my name"" ""Roc-A-Fella y'all"" 
 ""One of the best!"" 
 ""Waiting for my day to come"" 
 ""Just give me the word"" 
  
 Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your little nigga Bleek 
 Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street 
 Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced 
 At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes 
 Peep the steez, I represent for all those 
 With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys 
 Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys 
 Find a hood rat and creep to Mickey D's 
 First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it 
 Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't? 
 Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJs 
 Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger 
 You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her 
 Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us 
 Shit is constant, that's why I pack the 
 Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it? 
 I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall 
 Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all 
 That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all 
 Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead 
 One week of this hustling brought a living room set 
 Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out 
 Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out 
 Flashy, fly little nigga 
 Nosy bitch from the third floor like ""Why little nigga?"" 
 Bitch please, twist the trees 
 Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe 
 That's my answer, life's like cancer 
 And I'm serious 
  
 ""Waiting for my day to come"" 
 ""Just give me the word"""

"Focus on it every single day, I wanna figure out a way 
 To get ahead of what I think I know is coming 
 It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem 
 As if you've never been afraid, then why you runnin'? 
 I could never look at what I do the way that other people can 
 And walk away, I can't be separated from it 
 Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at 
 You wanna cut it up but can't, man, they can never take it from me 
 (I'm) Outlandish, take chances 
 Gotta get it while I can with my damage 
 My sanity could leave but if it vanished 
 Don't matter to me, I'd still manage 
 Gue-Guess you could say I'm at an advantage 
 My vantage point can be quite lavish 
 Got so many cadences 
 No way to pick one, which bag is my hand in 
 Depends what mood I'm in 
 Oh, no, I'm in a mood again 
 Lord knows I'm a hooligan 
 Losin' it, who can get gruesome with 
 You if it comes down to what you can bet? 
 I shoot direct, defuse the threat 
 And they wonder why the music has a huge effect? 
 Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth? 
 'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up 
 And want the music with the visuals, I got a vendetta 
 For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up 
 And take away the happiness, it can be kinda pathetic 
 But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache 
 I gotta be honest, I really been the cause of it, get it 
 'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see, you can tell when 
 I'm at the breakin' point, I finally had to sit with the devil 
 I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is yellin' 
 He tried to get me to live with him, even called me a sinner 
 And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner 
 So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up? 
 I took a moment, thought about it, feelin' caught in the middle 
 But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel 
 And I can never leave it, even if I made it to heaven 
 He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me 
 I'm like ""Woah (Woah), hold up, I don't think so"" 
 Skin and bones meet my ego 
 How's he look? He don't eat much 
 Let him starve, I don't feed him 
 I just beat him, I just leave him in his womb, in a fetal 
 Let him cry, let him yell, let him scream, I don't need him 
 Lift off when I'm ticked off, my pitfalls I latch onto like a pit dog 
 I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live 
 Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick 
 I hide in, wanna watch? Dive right in 
 My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin' 
 Just means I'm careful with the time I spend, so 
  
 (Look, look) Look what I, look what I done (Ayy) 
 Helpin' 'em people I love (I love) 
 My life is not what it was (No) 
 I do whatever I must (Woo) 
 Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy) 
 Count on one hand who I trust (Yeah) 
 Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy) 
 Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy) 
  
 Tech N9na, next king up 
 Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer 
 That lingua vexing ya 
 Leavin' a regular rapper resting, bruh (Chyeah) 
 This is what, I give it such 
 An incredible wicked rush, a vivid gush 
 Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff 
 Said, I better go rip it rough and I lit it up 
 The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (Whoop) 
 Lyrically elect me, Jet Li 
 The beat, it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (Whoop) 
 That is tellin' me ""Let's feed"" 
 On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus 
 Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest 
 Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive 
 A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (Chyeah) 
 The boogie monster rappin' with NF in the hoodie 
 Want to step into the session and fully conquer 
 The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (Chyeah) 
 Left in a wreck, never checkin' nor could he stomp us 
 Take his crown 
 Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakish frown 
 Shake his ground 
 Like I'm a Mechagodzilla, I'm such a killer when I break it down (Uh) 
 These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes 
 That need those Elite bros with the heat, so 
 They can eat on the D low 
 Off a beast yo' ego, got it vetoed (Chyeah) 
 Please close your beak foes, delete scrolls 
 Taken from me, thiefs chose to try to decode (Chyeah) 
 Reload the beat, so I can reach each soul 
 No cease, no finito, release (Go!) 
 I am the chosen and everyone is beholdin' 
 My energy is golden 'cause dominion is being broken 
 From enemies in the open approachin', I'm never jokin' 
 The remedy bein' spoken, I'm hopin' that you're soakin' it up (Chyeah) 
 I'm in the motion, I'm dope and I'm never chokin' 
 My devotion to floatin' like an ocean, the Holy Ghost and 
 I'm scopin' the evil folk and revokin' the wicked notion 
 I'm croakin', I'm really floatin' and quotin' that I'm closin' it up (Chyeah) 
 Talkin' behind my back 
 End up where N9ne is at see me and say 
 Kinda wack, you could not find the knack 
 Hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray 
 I'ma beat you 'cause I'm greedy and slay, if you're creepy and cray 
 I'ma eat you like PB&J, kiwi and grapes 
 I'ma demolish 'em when the T be in play, pray! 
 A stunna recordin' in my number three Jordans 
 Dungaree sportin', the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin' 
 The punishin' hunter eat like a hung-ary orphan (Chyeah) 
 T9 and NF are elephants 
 In the room without a closet for skeletons 
 Quit embellishin', a demon from hell is sent 
 Yell it went, Donny, you're outta your element! (Ayy) 
  
 Look what I, look what I done (Ayy) 
 Helpin' 'em people I love (I love) 
 My life is not what it was (No)

 Look what I, look what I done (What I done)

 Count on one hand who I trust (I trust; yeah) 
 Count on one hand who I trust (Ayy) 
 Count on one hand who I trust"

 Let's go 
  
 Snake and the bat, the haven that awakened you cap 
 From takin' a nap, shapin' a nation, hopin' they can adapt 
 To placin' the strap at Satan, a blatant attack 
 Hating's domination waitin' to be shaken, facin' Yates in the trap 
 Droppin' the faction that's lackin' African passion 
 When rapping crap is in action but the black assassin is happenin' 
 Laughin' 'cause I make 'em all a has-been 
 When I'm mashin', everybody that I'm passin' 
 Is gaspin' 'cause I'm elevation, Aspen 
 Get it brackin' in a Tecca Nina fashion 
 Super wordy 
 If you can serve me like a booth for thirty 
 But I'm Ruger, squirty 
 Language and this loofah dirty 
 I don't see another artist on a nigga level 
 When I get to go to get it started, I'ma hit the pedal 
 Anybody wanna be departed, come and get the rebel 
 That'll really be retarded like you're fuckin' with the devil 
 But you're not though, it's Picasso with a afro 
 You the cop, yo, that's soft, I say, ""Gestapo"" 
 Cotton swabs, we choppin' gods 
 And we're forsaking your wack jams 
 Making your rap fans follow Snake and the Batman

 So everybody please stand 
 For the Snake and the Batman

 To make fans in all the lands 
 He's a Snake and a Batman

"The warning of the one who's coming  
 Sending divine authority  
 The prophecy says  
 That people will flock to him  
 He will give them false hope  
 And when he's in power  
 He will destroy everything  
 He will change everything with one voice  
 If that one voice can change one person  
 It can change many  
 Many can change a city  
 A city can change a state  
 A state can change the nation  
 The nation can change the world  
 What if he is the King Of Darkness?"
"Real niggas do real things 
 Hanging with the honeys is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things, check 
  
 We started out making, small time bacon 
 Two little niggas baking, talking 'bout whipping cakes 
 Get clothing and big cheddar, hopin it gets better 
 We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever 
 In front of your building clocking, thought I was making a killing 
 Right in front of your children, eight-ball in my side pocket 
 They was corrupt too, disrespecting the fiends I used to 
 Look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you 
 In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York 
 I'm hollering Lifetimes, he hollering Life's Too $hort 
 Parallel lives and jewels held high 
 The Range or the rove, get exchanged, for your soul 
 You know how the game goes, slang to get cheese 
 And speak in Chinese, everybody gains the same dough 
 Get your shit scarred fucking with my sick squad 
 From Marcy, to the Bay y'all, we get large, bitch 
  
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Hanging with the honies is the song I sing 
 Real niggas do real things 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things 
 Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring 
 Real niggas do real things 
  
 So now you own a record label, I got one too 
 We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew 
 You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records 
 On the shelf and on the charts the double decker 
 The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me 
 You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook? 
 I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways 
 So I can get paid, everyday 
 I see the same old shit, I see in the streets 
 I know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats 
 Dope fiend music, it's drug-related 
 You can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it 
 It always sounds better when you turn it up loud 
 Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about 
 I know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas 
 It's just like in the streets mane, how much you get? 
  
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things

 That's right, I been a hustler for a long time 
 Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes 
 I started off with nothing ended up with everything 
 Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane 
 Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm saying 
 Always see me at the bank and yes I'm going again 
 There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy 
 Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy (that's right) 
  
 Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get 
 Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect 
 $hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow 
 I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know 
 I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fos 
 I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go 
 If you're balling, keep balling, if you jealous, stop 
 I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac 
 How real is that? 
  
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggas do real things

 Much love 
 $hort Dawg, get your money mane 
 All the way from the West coast 
 Uh, how real is that"
"Dear Lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know 
 In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J) 
 Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us 
 I know, try to make the best of bad situations 
 Seems to be my life's story 
 Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain 
 And can't nobody live this life for me 
 It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride  
 
 Somebody wake me, I'm dreamin' 
 I started as a seed, the semen 
 Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin' 
 On the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop 
 From a single drop, this is what they got 
 Not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser 
 Only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her 
 Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me 
 Stranded on welfare, another broken family 
 Now what was I to be? A product of this heated passion 
 Mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass 
 Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me 
 Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me 
 How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus 
 ""Will a nigga live or die?"" cause the Lord can't see us 
 In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine 
 No sunny days and we only play sometimes 
 When everybody's sleepin' 
 I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin' 
 I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone 
 I'm only 19, I'm tryna hustle on my own 
 On the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks 
 I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops 
 Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn 
 You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone 
 You can ask my man, he's a mind reader 
 Keep my 9 heater all the time, this is how we grind 
 Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out 
 Pass the weed, nigga! That Hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga 
 Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real, G"" 
 And my reply 'til they kill me: ""Act up if you feel me!"" 
 I was born not to make it, but I did 
 The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise  
 
 Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky) 
 And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry  
 
 I stay sharp as always 
 Runnin' your bricks with blitz, through your project hallways 
 Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day 
 Secrets of war prepare me for the worst 
 A life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse 
 But now my dreams, it seems though 
 Be placin' triple beams and things, bro 
 Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans  
 
 Now I plan to keep my Glock cocked 
 If trouble was searchin' for me, then why not? 
 Show 'em what I'm made of, plus raised on, on my block 
 Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street 
 Thugs snatchin' bags, we out for power, makin' cash 
 It wasn't fast, it'll make me mad, I'm just like him 
 My homie on the corner with his gat tucked in 
 Youngins, they buckin' somethin' 
 The life he lead's the life he don't need, don't we all know? 
 He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise  
 
 Dreams of lost hope 
 I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke 
 And still I rise, now I float, cowards ghost 
 Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down 
 Clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound 
 I used to hustle with my moms 'til the sun came 
 My homie Harm doin' time from this drug game 
 Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw 
 Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars 
 Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block 
 Crackheads only 10 learn to duck cops  
 
 In '96 my Glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards 
 No faces for open caskets, peelin' your cap backwards 
 You cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice 
 I send my missiles through your mattress 
 Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus 
 While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic 
 And loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin' 
 Leavin' your spleen to pick up 
 Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker 
 Let's go to war and see who draw quicker 
 And still I rise, and still I rise...  
 
 Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky) 
 And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry 
 Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky) 
 And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry 
  
 Y'all niggas fake, all day everyday 
 So now I got roller blades, bitch 
 Thought you knew 
 Your mouth is rich 
 C'mon pops, let's go!"
"It really used to bother me 
 Why award shows never calling me 
 Was not enough to hold the T down 
 'Cause I'm constantly chopping broccoli 
 They don't owe me no apology 
 I'm balling getting nightly neurology 
 Even though I got the lottery now 
 Ain't no thought of me, I do not agree 
  
 Staring at platinum and gold plaques 
 ""Fragile"", ""Hood Go Crazy"", ""Caribou Lou"", gold stacked 
 'Cause ain't nobody ever said that Tecca N9na flow wack 
 And that's the reason for babies' mamas, no cap 
 I read somewhere I had the most Top 10's on the Billboard rap charts 
 When you kill more, stacks start 
 I'm a mill grower at heart 
 And I led my people to the bread I teach you I'm a real lord, that part 
 I got the ill for a fact, art 
 But wait a minute 
 If you look up T9 history, yo the data's in it 
 In the gang we Strange and the gain big things because we play to win it 
 But to some, my shit seems invisible is the only way to spin it 
 Kinda like some 'op wanna play me out like I'm Sega Genes-is this stopping us? 
 Hell nah, got a lot of fans watching us 
 Saying God to us 
 But if Strange came through the window pane of the mainstream's oculus 
 It'll leave a lot of rappers with their mouth wide 
 Like the ring when people with the TV route died 
 I'm without cries 
 Because me and my partner built an empire and we did it on the outside 
  
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 On the outside 
 And when I'm home from getting it 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 On the outside 
 Here I come now 
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 On the outside 
 And when I'm home from getting it 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 On the outside 
 Here I come now 
  
 I get guap still 
 Even though people are not real 
 When it come to who got skill 
 Some just want a nigga pop pills 
 I done did it, I'll fly tongue spit it 
 Y'all eye swung hit a ball, drop deals 
 Started my own and stocked mills 
 But I kinda sense that blocked feel 
 Very little radio and TV time 
 That's what the outside mean when I free these lines 
 Like somebody determined to never see me shine 
 Completely deep inside, I know they really dying to meet me 
 To be a household name like Snoop, really would feel like felicity 
 But I think it takes a bit of a brighter image and enough of the right publicity 
 So as I sit and peep 
 Award shows like I'm a forbidden geek 
 Ignored so 'cause I love for living deep 
 With the lord flows, through the blood of risen chiefs 
 I love to see, all of my peers getting their credit 
 Through all of my years 
 Of eating the mic, I just swallow my fears 
 When beating this fight, never call on my tears 
 Even though so many cry over Yates 
 The music business treat me like I'm a flyover state 
 But I work this glow, merk this flow 
 Never been a day my clout died 
 Tech N9na, Strange Music 
 Built that thing on the outside 
  
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 On the outside 
 And when I'm home from getting it 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 On the outside 
 Here I come now 
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 On the outside 
 And when I'm home from getting it 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 On the outside 
 Here I come now 
  
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 Here I come baby 
 I'm coming to get ya 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 And it's such a beautiful picture 
 I get guap, I get guap, I get guap 
 All year round, all day and night 
 I just watch, I just watch, I just watch 
 No worries, everything's gonna be alright 
 On the outside"
"And my niggas say  
 We want the fame! 
 Come on! Come on!  
 
 One thing we all adore  
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game  
 Searchin' for fortune and fame  
 
 Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's 
 Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed 
 They got me hot when they shot me, plotted 
 My revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped 
 Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true 
 Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you 
 And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame 
 What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain? 
 Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times 
 Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time 
 I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse 
 I know, Death follows me, but I'll murder him first 
 And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless 
 Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
 Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses 
 We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask 
 I'm the first one to want him blasted 
 Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit 
 Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me 
 Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fakin' fame  
 
 Block run and shoot slugs  
 We throw them back like hardballs  
 Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes 
 And thugs I bleed to envy  
 Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny 
 Drunk nights, and hot days 
 Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways 
 A wife on the run, full of common blunts 
 Unconditionally married to my gun 
 Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires 
 Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance 
 Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame  
 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame  
 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain 
 A lost of the game, with life the cost of the game 
 We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain 
 All the blame belongs to the part of the brain 
 That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain 
 And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again 
 Outlaws don't die, so united we stand 
 And if family come before, all the fortune and fame  
 
 As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head 
 Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed 
 Hope they bless me the righteous way  
 Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today 
 Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg 
 Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg 
 I was passed down the street fame  
 Like Glocks clocked and keep aim 
 Was raised up with a clock box  
 And I ran with the local street gang  
 They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark 
 You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart 
 And that's some game that I got from generation of game 
 In the road of life, dog 
 We need to switch up lanes - think about it!  
 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Been nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame  
 
 I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame 
 It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change 
 I feel strange, I got so used to the hood 
 That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
 I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery 
 When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
 Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself 
 Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help 
 I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too 
 State of myself, my grind, and my family crew 
 Where one hand washes the other 
 No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers 
 The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build 
 And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed 
 And that's real, life that I was aimed to be 
 Love by my family tree, that's fame to me - how about it?  
 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game 
 Searchin' for fortune and fame 
 One thing we all adore 
 Something worth dyin' for 
 Nothin' but pain 
 Stuck in this game  
 Searchin' for fortune and fame"
"This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (This ain't music) 
 I'm 'bout to show you how a hustler's life (This is life man) 
 And a soldier's life parallel 
 And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain 
 (Forget about music for a second) 
 Picture a split screen (Forget musicians) 
 On one side, you got a hustler getting ready for the block 
 (Human beings) 
 Other side, you got a soldier getting ready for boot camp 
 (People, it's life) 
 They're both at war, stay with us 
  
 Did you ever notice, before you think? 
 Life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see 
 It will pass 
  
 You lost him mama, the war's calling him 
 Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them 
 He's a soldier 
 Rose through the ranks as the head of your household 
 Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed to 
 Now just remember why he's gone 'til November 
 It's part of him growing up 
 His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya 
 Your heart beating so fast, speeding his pulse up 
 Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds 
 A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps 
 Off to boot camp, the world's facing terror 
 Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan 
 Crack was anthrax back then, back when 
 Police was Al'Qaeda to black men 
 While I was out there hustling, sinning with no religion 
 He was off to war, killing for a living 
  
 Did you ever notice, before you think? 
 Life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see 
 It will pass 
  
 Days turn to nights, nights turn to years 
 Years turn to, ""How the fuck we make it in here?"" 
 My barracks average couple fights a day 
 Get you locked in a hole, won't see the light of day 
 And I feel like I'm just writing my life away 
 I never thought shit could end up quite this way 
 There's a war going on outside no man is safe from 
 I'm here for the good fight, only the fakes run 
 I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one 
 For my team or my siblings, what's my reason for living? 
 I love my niggas more than anything else 
 This war's about my family, me needing the wealth 
 You don't understand how useless as men we felt 
 'Til you become a five-star general 
 Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail 
 P.O.W's that's still in the war for real, for real 
  
 Did you ever notice, before you think? 
 Life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see 
 It will pass 
  
 Your baby boy is getting grown 
 So your baby boy is moving on 
 (I've gotta chase it) I'm gon' chase it 
 (And I'm gon' make it, yeah) I'ma make it 
 Your baby boy is getting grown 
 So your baby boy is moving on 
 (I'm gonna make it) I'm gon' make it 
 (Even if I gotta chase it) You gotta take it 
 Woo, yeah 
  
 Mama say prayer, your son's becoming a man 
 This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam 
 He ain't gon' always make the right choice understand 
 Every choice that he make, he makes it for his fam' 
 It's death before dishonor 
 And if he's gone, you should honor his memory 
 Don't cry, we all gonna die eventually 
 But if he's locked in the penitentiary, send him some energy 
 They're all winners to me, what's up Emory? 
  
 Did you ever notice, before you think? 
 Life goes fast 
 So don't you worry, about what you see 
 It will pass 
  
 Yeah, DJ Clue?, Desert Storm 
 The Blueprint, Part Two 
 Time for bonus coverage, c'mon"

 Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!) 
 But if a man test my Stuy 
 I promise he won't like my reply 
 Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial 
 I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some getting use to 
 Chain snatching, ain't have it, gotta get it 
 Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge 
 Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts 
 So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith 
 Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith 
 Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps 
 Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous

 Aw, man-I'm Jackie Robinson 
 'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen 
 Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me 
 Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey 
 From Brooklyn corners, burning branches of sticky 
 Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie 
 I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T 
 With no history in my borough, they borrow 
 With no intentions of returning tomorrow 
 The sun don't come out for many, like Annie 
 Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion 
 Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live 
 I go hard, I owe it all to the crib 
 Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

 While I'm doing my time due to circumstance 
 Cross that bridge, face the consequence 
 Once bid ten, now I paid my dues 
 Risk takers, we break the rules 
 Get so dark, but I see good 
 Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods 
 Now, let it ring out, it's a warning 
 (Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in 
 Gotta make it stick working like we blue collar 
 Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder 
 Right into the clip, bring it to the floor 
 One step, one step, give it up more 
 The road is rough and the street's a mess 
 Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish 
 Robbing out the commercial stash 
 Kill the voice screaming in my head

 Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass 
 Now you can see me in the coupe like WHAT

 I've got the magic stick, I can go for hours 
 From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower 
 With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky 
 I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry 
 I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub 
 Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love 
 I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed 
 This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

"Gave it a try, but I never considered the brothers would always try to hype me up 
 Shorty Macky, really psyched me up 
 When I wrote that back in the day, I was laughing to myself knowing they'd be jeffin' 
 When they hear this and they still do it today, but I wrote that style back in '87 
  
 I'm original, all they bite is a Tech's Mex 
 No residual, y'all should write us a blessed check 
 On the set, let's have a dialect test 
 Unequivocal, y'all are liars and Tech-esque 
 Why? I devour things 
 Kill 'em like a psycho shower scene 
 I'm authentic and y'all lost and sick 
 Shredded cheese, ground beef and sour cream 
  
 They be loving the way that N9na chop it up into pieces 
 They wanna thieve it, not even keep it a secret 
 But the way I kick it, they couldn't stick it with adhesive 
 They wanna reach it up on a level the beast is 
 But they release it, we'll thank American cheeses 
 That is the cheapest, they know the price of the Seepage 
 I frequent, why in this business, we go make peace with the leeches? 
 We are the teachers, like a penitentiary, got the bars to keep ya 
 Being all believers, if you're not welp, hard to reach us like a top-shelf margarita 
 I flowed the best way, on the mic I'ma go for let's-play 
 Gassing, I got to go collect pay, behold the set say 
 Dressing like a soldier, essay 
 Beat you with a fucking molcajete if you chose the Tech's spray 
 You tried to see though 
 Said you came up with it, then you lying like a Leo 
 I'm quite the hero, but the pacifist level has went to zero 
 Try me, I'll roll you up like a taquito 
 With chicken and chorizo, bean sauce 
 'Cause of biters, the N9na had many dreams lost 
 But then when I became the bee, cut the sting off 
 When the king boss bring frost, making your lowest temperature seem false

 If this pertaining to you, don't be sore papa 
 But you wallow my music like white on rice, that's horchata 
 Me checking you never pay homage to N9na is more caca 
 If you did not take nada from Tech you might live in a poor casa 
  
 It's over the way you sniffing and you digging in my hip folder to get dough bruh 
 I'm never yellin'  you get shoulder or better yet a pistola 
 Bet the quick flow up (Ha) 
 You became a big roller (Ha) 
 How you gonna hiss cobra right out your lips soldier, you hit a brick boulder (Ha) 
 And this ain't for the fan that is inspired, wanna yank from the man that is in fire 
 When he's dank on the jam and he win buyers, bank's gonna land on his empire 
 Speaking 'bout the mental robbers and get in the dollars 
 Never say how they got it, don't attend the holler 
 Never mentioning Tech is like a sin to Allah like cheddar on enchiladas, empanadas 
 I keep hearing the Tech N9na replay when I peep some of the cadences he spray 
 Use my formula to come up is cliche, but your movements are fishy ceviche 
 Everybody, they know Tech's flow, haters who clip it, they never pay no checks though 
 Tell 'em hasta luego, get low, hate it when I pop, fill up some Queso Fresco

 As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws 
 Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call 
 Plus this my homie from high school, he's getting by 
 It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry 
 Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls 
 We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall? 
 Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed 
 Get on the roof, let's get smoked out and blaze with me 
 2 in the morning and we still high assed out 
 Screaming ""thug till I die"" before I passed out 
 But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone 
 Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone 
 And all I got left are stinkin' memories 
 I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy 
 While trying to make it last 
 I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed 
 Cause life goes on

 Yeah nigga, I got the word is hell 
 Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L 
 Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole 
 Imagine life as a convict that's getting old 
 Plus with the drama we're looking out for your baby's mama 
 Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her 
 Life in the hood is all good for nobody 
 Remember gaming on dumb hotties at yo' parties 
 Me and you, no truer two 
 While scheming on hits 
 And getting tricks that maybe we can slide into 
 But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried 
 Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery 
 Though memories fade 
 I got your name tatted on my arm 
 So we both ball till my dying days 
 Before I say goodbye 
 Kato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!

 Bury me smiling with G's in my pocket 
 Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it 
 Let the hoes that I used to know 
 From way before kiss me from my head to my toe 
 Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin 
 A couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in 
 Tell all my people I'm a Ridah 
 Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride 
 Until I get free, I live my life in the fast lane 
 Got police chasing me 
 To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews 
 Niggas that guided me through back in the old school 
 Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies 
 See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me 
 And brothers, miss ya while your gone 
 You left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn? 
 Life goes on 
  
 How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
  
 Life goes on homie 
 Gone on, cause they passed away 
 Niggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit 
 I feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya 
 You know what I mean 
 Last year we poured out liquor for ya 
 This year nigga, life goes on 
 We're gonna clock now 
 Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby 
 Next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga 
 They're gonna be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up"" 
 That's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch 
 Hey Kato, Mental 
 Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man 
 Don't front

 Almost on E and so we stop to get some gas  
 Somewhere outside of Arizona people's persona  
 Seem like they put niggas in a coma or bullets in their ass fast 
 I went in to get some petroleum rodeo circus  
 These trashy mothafuckers trying to show me they tat's  
 On purpose swastika's here swastika's there minding my affairs

 I punched him back and said ""Take that from a black""  
 His posse ran up I threw my hand up said ""Let loose the gats""  
 They said ""We're the type of boys that kill coons by the hour

 And I'm about to increase the ratio"" while we were scrappin' I heard coon monkey ape baboon  
 I heard my partner's lettin' loose, they cleared the room 
 I let off a couple inside their racist encephals

 See them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on 
 Saw it comin' a mile away and it figures 
 Somebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car ""whites own niggers"" 
 Paid it no mind now it's lunch time 
 I'm eating quietly then a voice said 
 ""You don't belong in society"" 
 I looked then I felt like gaggin' 
 This white trash mother fucker 
 I heard that he was the grand dragon 
 Fuck it I'ma tag him, skull drag him 
 But his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots 
 This is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous 
 Stigmatism is realism the idealism is to hinder us 
 Put his fingers in my face I bent 'em back 
 He said ""you fuckin' jerk"" and told me to watch my back after work 
 I punched out and walkin' to my car  
 I'm driving and I see this motherfucker he's following me from afar 
 Pulled over like an idiot jumped out and said what's happenin'

 When teaching hatred hatred at the steeple steeple 
 Lethal sequels when churches burn we purchase germs 
 Like guns to slaughter all the motherfuckin' surface worms 
 Be warned all fronts got the right to fall once 
 And the racists be the ones we call dunce 
 Down to die for my love so before you cease us 
 You gotta (what?) crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks"
"You're now tuned into the muh'fucking greatest (Jigga)

 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you 
 Get that dirt off your shoulder 
  
 I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force 
 Trying to hustle some things that go with the Porsche 
 Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced 
 Middle finger to the law, nigga, gripping my balls 
 Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they're screaming 
 All the ballers is bouncing, they like the way I be leaning 
 All the rappers be hating off the track that I'm making 
 But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it 
 Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops 
 Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block 
 Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block 
 I can run it back, nigga, 'cause I'm straight with the Roc 
  
 If you feeling like a pimp

 Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda 
 I just whipped up a watch, trying to get me a Rover 
 Trying to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir 
 Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya 
 But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealing 
 Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em 
 Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceiling 
 In case 52 broads come out, now you chilling 
 With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve 
 At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen 
 I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean 
 No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real 
  
 If you feeling like a pimp 
 Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
 Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

 Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map 
 Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach 
 I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap 
 I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black 
 I drop that Black Album, then I back out it 
 As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me 
 From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys 
 From Os to opposite of Orphan Annie 
 You gotta pardon Jay, for selling out the Garden in a day 
 I'm like a young Marvin in his hey' 
 I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony 
 Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

"(Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 Baby, your dada loves you 
 And I'ma always be here for you 
 (Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 No matter what happens 
 You're all I got in this world 
 (Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 I would never give you up for nothin' 
 (Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me 
 I love you 
  
 C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach 
 Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat 
 Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
 Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk 
 Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
 But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women 
 That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit 
 Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No) 
 And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
 Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah) 
 And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float 
 And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
 It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt 
 Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin' 
 And spilled ketchup on her shirt 
 Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water 
 And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
  
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I (See, honey) 
  
 There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell 
 A place called prison and a place called jail 
 And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one 
 'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson 
 And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah) 
 Maybe when you're old enough 
 To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya 
 But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad 
 Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad 
 But I still feel sad that I put her on time out 
 Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out 
 I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba? 
 Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga? 
 Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee 
 Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty 
 Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water 
 '97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter 
  
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I 
  
 Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play 
 We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier 
 Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea 
 Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama) 
 That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry 
 Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake 
 Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah) 
 We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock 
 Ready now, here we go, on the count of free 
 One, two, free, whee (whoosh) 
 There goes Mama, splashin' in the water 
 No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order 
 No more step-dada, no more new brother 
 Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy) 
 Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk 
 But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk 
  
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 And when we ride 
 Just the two of us, just the two of us 
 Just you and I 
  
 (Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world 
 (Just the two of us, just the two of us) 
 Just me and you 
 Your dada will always be here for you 
 Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that 
 If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you 
 You ever need anything, just ask 
 Dada will be right there 
 Your dada loves you 
 I love you, baby"
"Yeah.. Ja, you ready? Drop that 
 Ferrari F 50 style baby (yeah, yeah)

 I keep hearin' niggas is happy, the D's come, niggas wit guns 
 When I'm out on bail, ridin' wit' some new ones 
 Big got hit in that passenger seat 
 Pac got hit in that passenger seat 
 Now I'm ridin' 'round in that passenger seat 
 Come near the whip, I'm blastin' my heat 
 It don't take long, for my juvenile delinquent thinkin' to sink in 
 The consequences mean nothin', those semi auto's is bustin' 
 Crack sellin', predicate villain, spit big words but I can't spell 'em 
 Put a shot to your melon, that'll keep you're punk ass from chillin' 
 Then I got that nine and a fo'-fo', that H2 is never full 
 Bullet proof windows and doors, gangsta how 'bout yours 
 Southside tatted on my back 
 My last gun shipment got the whole hood strapped 
 Now all I got is two 380's and a nine 
 Nigga you can knock and tell the cops but you're dyin'

 I used to chill in the hood, to support the fiends 
 But now I'm eatin' caviar instead of pork and beans 
 I'm in the money green 7-45, with 7 shots in the fo' five 
 Y'all niggas wanna die? 
 I got a love affair, wit' violence and guns 
 So this is for them gangstas, rep' where you from 
 When I got O'd up, my heart turned colder 
 That's why the mac react like a king cobra 
 Now I'm jumpin' out of Rovers, in Gucci loafers 
 Y'all niggas wanna stun? I'll bury you cockroaches 
 Gimme one year, in this industry 
 I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country  
 
  
  
 Still walk around wit' the hammer boss 
 Rope and a cross 
 Hard times'll make a lil' nigga hate Santa Claus 
 Your mountains is high, holdin' in Diana Ross 
 I'm like a 2003 banana Porsche 
 I don't gotta hide sluts, to get your ties cut 
 They on my dick, 'cause I make groupies set off a fire truck 
 My team in the cutt, packin' middle things 
 I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings 
 It's 8 class karats in the border 
 I poke holes in plastic, to avoid a vaginal disorder 
 I'm a savage on your daughter 
 She ain't in the college dorm 
 Then I guess I'm squirtin' on the cabin that you bought her 
 I'm a heavy weed smoker, so the average is a quarter 
 Brown colored from shit, he established in the water 
 You got Banks on your jersey, you part of my fan base 
 Just 'cause you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes"

 But they hearts not in it, see, everything's for the paper 
 The struggle for the right side of history 
 Independent thought is like an eternal enemy 
 Capitalist posing as compassionates be offending me 
 Yeah, suck my dick, with authenticity 
 Yeah, Tupac dead, got to think for yourself 
 Yeah, hero's looking for the villains to help 
 I never been sophisticated, same face 
 Being manipulative such a required taste 
 I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people 
 They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking 
 And they like to wonder where I've been 
 Protecting my soul in the valley of silence"
"And I ain't trying to be no husband 
 I'm just trying to get your loving 
 Ain't no time for you to be stubborn 
 Hey! And I ain't that kind that just be hovering

 We started in the Midwest 
 Now we 'bout to take it 
 All over the world, baby! 
 This is the pinnacle! 
 Yeah, Tech N9ne!  
 
 Follow me, all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology 
 They could never manage, we do damage with no apology 
 Pick 'em off the panic, got a little manic 'cause I gotta be 
 Frantic, I'mma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity 
 Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas 
 I could pop at you, proper, 'cause I'm partners with Waka Flocka 
 Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch 'em make 'em rock 
 With a show-stopper, chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers) 
 If you anybody, you notice it 
 Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul as it 
 Loaded cold as the polar get, wrote it quick and they quoted it 
 Yo, when exploded, the flow behold it, 'cause when that motor spit 
 A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real 
 Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels 
 Gimme the knock and I'mma chop it, he came and he went tomorrow 
 But I'mma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas 
  
 Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough 
 Trippin' when I rip it up, I be the X when I split 'em up 
 Sorta like I was liquored up and backin' up in the gut 
 Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I buzz 
 From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina 
 If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous 
 Can I cuss, fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous 
 Leave 'em in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standin' up 
  
 Tech is hostile, he's awful 
 He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle 
 You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle 
 He's thinkin' he give it to Poe and toss to Picasso 
 Killin' everybody off is the motto 
 And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel 
 You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco 
 I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go 
  
 I'm light years 
 Ahead of my peers 
 Want some, you can come bring it right here 
 Can't clown me 
 Don't come 'round me 
 Bow down, I was crowned when they found me 
  
 K.C.  
 
 Check it, I'm ahead of 'em, chop it up with the veteran 
 A legend developin', they gotta tell 'em it's evident 
 Gotta notice an elephant, none of you niggas relevant 
 You delicate, I'm lovin' every second of this 
  
 Denmark  
 
 De vil alle tjekke nÃ¥r vi ligger det 
 Kommer ind og smÃ¦kker det beatet jeg vÃ¦kker det 
 I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund

 Det minder mig om vi stikker det af 
 For de kalder mig alle vild worldwide chopper

 You know whats coming out of my mouth 
 Hanging with the coolest guys 
 It reminds me we stepping it

 Alabama  
 
 What if I ran into you with a Pogo stick? 
 Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness? 
 With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet 
 And I threw up more churches like I was playin' Hamlet? 
 Syllable burnin', that internal damage 
 Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock 
 Under an oak tree, like I was peelin' pecans 
 But instead, I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sand-a-wich 
 Pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a 
 Motherfucker from inside a 1987 box 
 I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks 
 Fuck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks 
 Feel every bump like you had dead shocks, 
 But I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped 
 Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne, twist up the pine 
 And smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes, well, sure, why not? 
 Really don't need to show any more of my cock 
 But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks 
 In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch 
 Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks 
 Slumerican is out of control 
 Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go 
 But I'm a dump truck, just send another load 
 Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throat 
 With an alien probe 
  
 I'm light years 
 Ahead of my peers 
 Want some, you can come bring it right here 
 Can't clown me 
 Don't come 'round me 
 Bow down, I was crowned when they found me 
  
 Twista! 
 Chicago  
 
 Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm 
 Or loosen the venom and hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism 
 And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance 
 That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies 'cause of cannibalism 
 Breakin' 'em off into particles, they get in a predicament 
 That be never reversible 'cause a nigga be too versatile 
 Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel 
 I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you 
 Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic 
 After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have 
 'Cause I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy 
 To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy 
 Hoppin' I don't stop what that follows when the flame's thrown 
 I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known 
 Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there 
 We WWC, if you can't keep up, shoulda stayed home 
 My alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers' 
 Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology 
 So play me and I'mma be shinin' on them haters 
 I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be 
 Like a helicopter when the words fly 
 Entire families all the way out to you girl die 
 If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists 
 Don't even try to stop us 'cause we choppers and we worldwide 
 And I'm- 
  
 I'm light years

 Can't clown me 
 Don't come 'round me 
 Bow down, I was crowned when they found me 
  
 New York  
 
 See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude 
 And when I'mma cock it and pop it and when I'mma drop it, my dude 
 Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude 
 To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude 
 And then they ask ""What in the world is you provin'? 
 When you were already the best? And what the hell is he doin'?"" 
 Well, I'mma be choppin' and cuttin' and breakin' and beatin' and shakin' 
 And fuckin' everything up 'til I make no further mistake 
 And bustin' everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican 
 And shuttin' everything up, especially the ones who be hatin' 
 They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid 
 You hear 'em now? ""D-d-d-d-don't do-do-do-do it! 
 P-P-P-Please? Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us? 
 W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!"" 
 And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em, and finish 'em 
 And bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em, and then I'll 
 Hit 'em again at a minimum, creepin' comin' to kill 'em 
 Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em, thinkin' ""They gotta be feelin' 'em!"" 
 Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em?

 Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs 
 For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act 
 Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep 
 Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain 
 Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game? 
 Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked 
 Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket 
 How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast 
 Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash 
 My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate 
 Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break 
 Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed 
 Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest 
 I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc 
 They all duckin' when my gun smoke 
 You ain't shit without your homeboys  
 
 You probably run at the sound of funk 
 I give a fuck, you niggas is punks

 We could have took it to the fists, I would have laid you out 
 Niggas be actin' all different when they dogs come around 
 Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down 
 They all clown, better yet they all stunned  
 You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once 
 Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel 
 Outlawz you'll never forget, Makaveli the Don get a call y'all 
 Turnin these streets into Vietnam 
 Where your homeboys?  
 
 You ain't shit without your homeboys

 I ain't shit without my homeboys 
 (Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)  
 
 Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone 
 Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone 
 Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated 
 One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded 
 My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy 
 Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies 
 My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride 
 To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die 
 Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence 
 From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession 
 Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D 
 You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me 
 Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack 
 Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back. Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together 
  
 Ain't shit without your homeboys 
 Thug niggas, I love niggas

"""Boarding completed 
 I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3 
 Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes 
 And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet 
 At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features 
 Relax and breathe normally"" 
  
 Uh, coming down like I'm uphill 
 Hogging both lanes better than a bus will 
 She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel 
 But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still 
 I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather 
 Then step out like Chicago in its finest era 
 You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra 
 Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort 
 Ha-ha, I let the world know 
 I chose to keep to myself and let the world go 
 And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know 
 So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up 
 I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one 
 Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston 
 Speeding on the 1-0-5 'til the fucking badge come 
 Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson 
  
 And I'm a trip 
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip 
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip 
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this 
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down 
 Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now 
 I got enough of the mojo to go around 
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town 
 'Cause I'm a trip 
  
 Landing on another runway, fly with me 
 Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee 
 Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on 
 Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron 
 I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business 
 Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches 
 Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes 
 Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those 
 And she know what this is, hey lil' mama 
 Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama 
 But why you always in somebody face lil' mama? 
 Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama) 
 Nigga, I gotta be that nigga 
 If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga 
 Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage 
 Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge 
  
 And I'm a trip 
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip 
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip 
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this 
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down 
 Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now 
 I got enough of the mojo to go around 
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town 
 'Cause I'm a trip 
  
 Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that 
 That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack 
 Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks 
 So I can live on a hill just off a few raps 
 I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit 
 That might be outer space, the Jupiter district 
 I quadruple my vision 
 If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open 
 I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking 
 On some Compton shit 
 Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch 
 You see my city is the city of Lamar 
 It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all 
 The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping 
 The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan 
 I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming 
 So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing 
  
 And I'm a trip 
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip 
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip 
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this 
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down 
 Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now 
 I got enough of the mojo to go around 
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town 
 'Cause I'm a trip

 Good. Hope to see you next time"""
"Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning

 Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting 
 Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping 
 When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in

 Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it 
 Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic 
 Believe me, it's easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you 
 I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting 
 Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun 
 One 911 emergency, it's murder, B 
 It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger 
 No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas 
 Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain 
 See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game 
 Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass 
 Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav 
 Nigga, it's not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride 
 Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by 
 I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash 
 I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

 You better lose yourself in the moment 
 Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go 
 You only get one shot before I back out and fire back 
 At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack 
 Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that 
 The 70s was smack, the 80s crack 
 The 90s was grimy, millennium MACs, man 
 Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them 
 Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed 
 God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps 
 End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt 
 Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out 
 Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out 
 Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow 
 You know tomorrow's just a day away 
 If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

"Yeah, caged bird 
 Something like a caged bird 
 Caged bird 
 Yeah, look 
  
 You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga 
 Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga 
 I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga 
 Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed 
 By reefer clouds and bottles 
 In and out of county jail 
 This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells 
 With they heads down 
 And they fists clenched tight 
 Thinking ""I could bust a hole through this wall 
 And bitch I just might"" 
 It's just like the caged bird I sing a song 
 Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home 
 I cry when I'm alone 
 I'm wondering why would God send me here 
 Knowing that they hate us 
 Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people 
 Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs 
 We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed 
 Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity 
 I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me 
  
 A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird) 
 (Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird 
 Yeah, caged bird 
 Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion 
 And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs? 
 This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years 
 Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs 
 We wish that you was here 
 A mother's tear spilled on this page 
 A brother's tear spilled on this page 
 How many days left? 
 And can you find peace when you released 
 Still filled up wit' rage 
 Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage  
 
 Well, it's the oratory vet 
 Turned down king slash poet laureate 
 Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect 
 I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps 
 With a shorty on my lap 
 With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect 
 I could've been a dealer in the party with the X 
 But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess 
 I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret 
 Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full? 
 I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him 
 I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form 
 You think you standing for something you on a trap door 
 Well it's the, Mr. Introspective 
 I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception 
 I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things 
 That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women 
 Drinking cognac I'm past grinning 
 A sexy dress, fat ass in it 
 But still hit it till I'm half-winded 
 Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit 
 Well I be hitting all these dimes 
 See I'm caged by the visions of the blind 
 I started as a king 
 Turned to a slave 
 Put us in our chains 
 We was forced to entertain 
 Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage 
 Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage 
 As I sing  
 
 A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird) 
 (Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird 
 Yeah, caged bird 
 Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion 
 And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs? 
 This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years 
 Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs 
 We wish that you was here 
 A mother's tear spilled on this page 
 A brother's tear spilled on this page 
 How many days left? 
 And can you find peace when you released 
 Still filled up wit' rage 
 Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage"

"Check it out 
 Hey Kyu! 
  
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK) 
 I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) 
 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK) 
 I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) 
 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
  
 One day I plan to be a family man happily married 
 I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried 
 'Til I'm glad to be buried 
 And leave this crazy world 
 And have at least a half a million for my baby girl 
 It may be early to be planning this stuff 
 'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough 
 'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough 
 I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed 
 My hands have been cuffed 
 But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff 
 Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts 
 I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been troubled enough 
 And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see 
 My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased 
 With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese 
 I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call 
 Way before my baby is able to crawl 
 I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates 
 To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades 
 I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth 
 Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu 
  
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK) 
 I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) 
 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)

 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
  
 I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps 
 Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap 
 Praying for sleep 
 Dreaming with a watering mouth 
 Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse 
 In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts 
 With the root of all evil 
 I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful 
 And make them do shit illegal 
 For these Grants and Jacksons 
 These transactions explain a man's actions 
 But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
 Through God and there's a wish he granted me 
 He showed me how to cope with the stress 
 And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed 
 Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest 
 To selling dope with the rest 
 I quit smoking cess to open my chest 
 Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
 Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel 
 My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics 
 He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts 
 Kids attract static, children with automatics 
 Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets 
 I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum 
 I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum 
 It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth 
 But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth 
  
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK) 
 I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) 
 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
 It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK) 
 I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright) 
 It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep) 
 It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here) 
  
 Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep 
 Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep"
"Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow 
 Cole world, get ya Pea Coat 
 Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so 
 Ain't no mystery why there picking me for 
 I've been hot since '97, I ain't Mr Cee though 
 I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy 
 I'm skinny, didn't eat so I'm hungry like a hostage 
 Finally seeing money so it's funny how they eyes lit 
 Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on 
 I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn't get on 
 One time for my city bitch I'm putting it on 
 Like a condom when I'm with your girl, ballin' like it's intramural 
 Back in school, hoopin' to impress the girls 
 We was young and disconnected from the rest of World 
 I reminsce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl 
 She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves 
 Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned 
 From her, wasn't nothing like it 
 We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back 
 I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that 
 Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that 
 If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her 
 But was just a virgin, couldn't make it past flirting 
 Now I'm taking baths with there naked ass jerkin 
 Make It Last forever playing in the background 
 You can that as whatever I was laying that down 
 She gon hat emy ass forever, I ain't gon bring her back round 
 But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected? 
 Sending all them texted spillin on your dresses 
 We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast'es 
 I never disrespected, I'm clever nigga check it 
 I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message 
 This is Cole, ain't nothing like it 
 So girls don't wanna fuck him, now they wanna fuckin' like him 
 And hope you fuckin' wife him 
  
 Yeah, nuttin' like him 
 Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh 
  
 Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas 
 A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me 
 Rappers throwin' jabs but it feel like nothing hit me 
 Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me 
 Scratch that, can't impersonate perfection man 
 But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan 
 Now uh uh, apparently some of y'all comparing me 
 Either you blind as hell or either you just don't care to see 
 Don't make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me 
 Go fuck around and get your favourite rapper embarrassed, see 
 I'm the supplier of that fire and the kerosene 
 Don't wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired 
 Just know the shit that I'm dropping, take you a lot higher 
 These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs Doubtfire 
 How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire 
 The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes 
 You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies 
 I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it 
 I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it 
 I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it 
 Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it 
 Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret 
 Until the world find out and then y'all gotta share me 
 Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me 
 Yeah you fucking hear me 
 Yeah, yeh"

 Serious radio, y'all know what it is 
  
 Nas too real, Nas true king 
 You know the king 
  
 Cars with police radars on highways bopping 
 Bullpin therapy cell block dodging 
 Pissy stairways missed them days not when 
 They shut down the stores when I'm shopping 
 Used to be pop locking, train hopping 
 Face covered in stocking 
 Six pack Bud drinking gambler 
 Fuck them cameras in front of the man 
 Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck 
 More hits than gambling huff 
 I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes 
 I was a soldier with the Popeyes sipping Amota 
 Nigga honestly I call this a culture 
 My sister's a snake, my brother's a vulture 
 My mother's the block, my father's a ghetto piranha 
 Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama 
 Obama, if the kids mirror you 
 We'll all push Maseratis with the silver hue 
 They fear that connection 
 I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection 
 Gotti was a racist but he still get praises 
 We don't give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta 
 Bricks come with Bill Clinton's name on it taped up 
 Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them 
 Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim 
 Know some hood girls who did time that could take them 
 Rappers changing families, fags are all lost 
 I'm at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve 
 Save the small talk, I feel alive 
 New Porches Jordan number fives 
 Already said I'm the last real nigga alive

 That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop) 
 So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal 
 But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out? 
 Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out 
 Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out 
 The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous 
 Because if cleanliness is next to godliness 
 It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself 
 And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun 
 Still on top the pile 
 Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial 
 Quick to call you out on your bullshit 
 Don't make me give that crock a dial 
 'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator 
 Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one 
 So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account 
 So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the 
 Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah) 
 I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that 
 Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit 
 'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck) 
 But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans 
 I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah) 
 Go in my garage, start my van 
 Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can 
 And doze off like  
 But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants 
 If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors 
 Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons) 
 Small, medium, and large size cans 
 Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands 
 Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and 
 If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands 
  
 Shit, hold on, man 
 Motherfucker 
 Happy birthday to- 
 Fuck (Shh, quiet) 
  
 I sit in silence in candlelit environments 
 Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent 
 Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this 
 But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes 
 Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this 
 I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch 
  
 What the fuck? Hold on, wait 
 ""I'm Diddy's side bitch?"" 
 Oh, I'm still east side, bitch 
  
 So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD 
 Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup) 
 From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch) 
 Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha) 
 So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus) 
 'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall 
 Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh) 
 Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn) 
 My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah) 
 I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law 
 Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh) 
 Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs 
 'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked 
 This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr) 
 This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp"" 
 I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt"" 
 Then go eat some worms, like the early bird 
 What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word 
 Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth 
 Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt 
 And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda) 
 But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn) 
 And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh) 
 Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ) 
 Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark 
 At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art 
 And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't 
 No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf 
 But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking) 
 And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park 
 I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard) 
 'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when 
 It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten 
 'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again 
 And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins) 
 The cypher begins 
 I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe 
 It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin 
 My mind is a recycling bin 
 There's no place I never been 
 But I never budge and I never bend 
 You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends 
 Like adult diapers for men 
 Even when I'm rappin' less stellar 
 It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar) 
 Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth 
 And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route 
 So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds 
 Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you 
 But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter 
 'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah) 
 So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap 
 Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha) 
 No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree 
 Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree 
 You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea 
 You're always punkin' out like Halloween 
 You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk 
 Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump 
 And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump 
 Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk 
 Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to 
 Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah 
 This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome 
 'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album 
 So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer 
 The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt 
 I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood 
 It's lookin' like it's that time of the month 
 Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt 
 I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but 
 Y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vÃ¡monos 
 I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable 
 Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome 
 Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo 
 Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope 
 You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole 
  
 Wait, why'd the beat cut off? 
 Fuck it"

"I remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin' 
 When I went to all the shows yo my bros are bitchin 
 Never meant to blow my goal so its motor spittin 
 And when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position 
  
 I promise, to be the best to mom ya 
 Us through get up at the dawn let tech spew flip it like an omelette 
 Ever since the calm bet you tech ain't made you yawn yet 
 All signed checks in my pocket are the color of pawn shrek 
  
 The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it 
 If its beyond us even so I get the gauntlet 
 This music shit was enough to make me vomit 
 But I kept you all astonished make way for the kc comet 
  
 Now I'm winning I'm more sarcastic than vince vaughn yeah 
 Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats 
 Cause them don't want tech to go straight non vet 
 Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised  
 
  
 Would you let me kiss em couldn't defeat me none 
 We started beastin em sellin records mellin seconds 
 Look at us teachin em yellin tech is hell and methods 
 Rippin and reachin em, felon jeffers tellin heffers 
  
 I ain't got no income but I got dough and then some 
 In come some friends they wanna attend hundreds send em 
 Knockin em out my chain go side to side just like a pendulum 
 I'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin for the sin to come 
  
 This is what goes on now that I'm in their light 
 Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights 
 Been chasin this for so long never has been fair fights 
 Lookin for them rare sights. it's in there right? 
  
 In the land where everything is yours 
 Not fictitious like the boars all delicious like a smoors. 
 I'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores 
 Got me bossin doin more for the promiseland I'm you and yours, nina  
 
  
 Is this it? is this what it's all about man? 
 Eating. drinking. fucking. sucking. snorting. come on man. 
 Meeting. feeling. touching. we on dames. 
 Killing. busting. really loving us cause we all strange. 
  
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha I like it 
 The promiseland is real simply because I write it. 
 Don't stare too long and envy cause you might get eye-ritis 
 Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices 
  
 In promiseland, I'm gonna stand, an honest man 
 This honor gets the drama yes the llama can 
 Bring disaster on rappers like water on japan 
 He got his chance and tech puts it all on his fans"
"I wanted to find my gun, my lady runs to the bathroom 
 Yelling ""someone"", and when it's done 
 I'ma treat it like my daughters and son, we having fun 
 'Till intruders came knocking to come kill everyone 
 The beat and the kick ringing my bell uncontrollably 
 Four in the morning yelling my name so they know it's me 
 Scramble and try to find my nigga's gun, I'm supposed to be 
 Prepared for the crazy, my lady screaming don't go to see 
 Fuck it, I'm going down to the kitchen to get the knife 
 Invite 'em all in my crib and then take everybody's life 
 Chop 'em all into pieces, pray to God they heat-less 
 He in D shit, play with their bodies in the name of Jesus 
 One, two, three, god damn it's just the cops 
 All the motherfuckers must've scramm' when we hit the block 
 I was gonna kill am I wrong to feel 
 For my loved safety I'll leave you permanently still 
 Trav said he caught them on camera they came to his place 
 Two teen girls and the guy yelling ""where is Yates"" 
 Damn some fans would've lost some lives on this day 
 Mistaken, I would've been erasing all of the kid's face  
 
 Am I my paranoid or scared 
 Or is this my nightmare 
 Were they ever really there? 
 Tell me if I'm tripping 
 Am I supposed to sit and wait 
 While they storm through the gate 
 Psycho just like Norman Bates 
 Tell me if I'm tripping  
 
 Yeah, it's gonna be the shit, wait 'till you hear this, man. 
 You on keyboard, I gotta get this fixed, man, damn... 
 Alright, there we go. Alright man, sit over there though 
  
 Seven o'clock, I was upstairs 
 I was on the keyboard making that tear 
 Knock on the front door, C.O. got it 
 Niggas came in, I said ""Yo, get in the closet"" 
 Hit 'em with venom and run up in 'em while they rummagin' 
 Too many niggas was coming in, I wanna get me one 
 Hopin' niggas try me cause I'm finna feel like ""fry me"" 
 Eyes all Chinese, high off reefer 
 I'ma get deeper, turn to the Grim Reaper 
 Use a heat seeker when I creep with the heater 
 Leave a deep gash, bring the heat fast 
 Hit 'em with the venom, when I get 'em I'ma keep 'em 
 Giving them an enema, even if it's ten of 'em 
 Then I'ma, eat 'em like dinner in the cinema 
 Then I'ma, shit 'em out, get 'em out 
 In about twenty-four seconds I'ma fuck 'em in the ass 
 Tuck 'em in the grass, cut 'em up fast 
 Buttercup, shut 'em up, I'ma cut mass 
 I'ma cut lass, nigga he got it, he gotta fuck 'em up, yeah 
 Tell me if I'm tripping  
 
 Am I my paranoid or scared 
 Or is this my nightmare 
 Were they ever really there? 
 Tell me if I'm tripping 
 Am I supposed to sit and wait 
 While they storm through the gate 
 Psycho just like Norman Bates 
 Tell me if I'm tripping  
 
 I don't really wanna play this, guys... This isn't something to mess around with 
 Come on, it's just a game, nothing to worry about, sit down 
 (Hey, man, hand me one of those beers) 
 But it's not just a game... 
 It is, everything is gonna be fine, hand me a beer too. Come on, let's do it  
 
 I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994 
 And a group of us was chilling at the table, we was drinking with our fingers on the Ouija board 
 Tryna summon spirits asking ""Ouija, can you hear us?"" never thinking what was in store 
 Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness, all of a sudden it was knocking at the front door 
 Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open 
 Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion, no one was there, we went back to the board hoping 
 That we finally made contact, with the deity, apparition on the other side 
 Then it started moving out and soon it was spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die 
 We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment 
 On the way home Sarah hit a patch of ice, lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life  
 
 Am I my paranoid or scared 
 Were they ever really there? 
 Tell me if I'm tripping 
 Am I supposed to sit and wait 
 While they storm through the gate 
 Psycho just like Norman Bates 
 Tell me if I'm tripping 
  
 Fuck that shit, nigga, hmm, let's party"
"Sin with me I want you. She-devils in the house let me hear ya

 You used to be nerdy bitch 
 Now she's in the backyard fuck thirty pits  
 
 Now besides being on ex and regardless of having sex

 As soon as my wife push me her mans fucking a trick 
  
 (I don't care she know I trick) but she's starting to get hip 
 To it cause she's finding matches inside of my pockets 
 That say I strip which means I might get caught lose 
 Everything that I bought, the house, the kids, and the car I know it sounds Bizarre 
  
 But we should give her a call and see if she want it in that way 
 It's 3-way sex and we can all be friends 
 I know you've done it before don't act like you haven't whore

 Fucking with your pussy it's a handful you think 
 I'm drowning then you clowning 
 So basically bitch you're a damn fool and that's a given fact 
 Plus I remember back when you was young I could see 100 niggas thru your gap 
  
 And all of them was probably hitting that  
 That's embarrassing you're stuck with 30 children, 20 miscarriages 
 In and out of buildings aint caring who it is fucking newlyweds 
 Didn't mean to do it but you did slut  
 
 Devilish she's never to be faithful 
 Credit or fee it's better that she's tranquil 
 Even a apple my cock can unlock 
 The key to your asshole 
  
 Stop the plot do the freeze on my cash flow 
 Cock the gloc I thru these in the castle 
 Fresh outta school with a disease and a tassle 
 Ski's and it's natural you just my ho that's the reason you stack dough"
"I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up 
 I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
  
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes 
 Stay to myself like loners do 
 Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood 
 To politic or be fake with you 
 We apologize if you ever knew 
 Too many niggas, and not enough hoes 
 And most of you niggas, acting like hoes 
  
 Everything I do is too alumni 
 I'ma take my time, I'ma master it 
 You should be mindful of a mastermind 
 Put a landmine right where your mamma live 
 Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before 
 See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report 
 That I done you wrong, and I mean you know my home endeavors 
 Nigga right now, it's now or never 
 Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however 
  
 I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up 
 I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
  
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes 
 Stay to myself like loners do 
 Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood 
 To politic or be fake with you 
 We apologize if you ever knew 
 Too many niggas, and not enough hoes 
 And most of you niggas, acting like hoes 
  
 Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre 
 And they wanna tell me, I made it 
 Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout 
 I'ma take his wrist and break it 
 Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here 
 And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear 
 Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate 
 Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have 
  
 I know a lot of people that smile in my face 
 But talk behind my back every time I'm gone 
 So when they call my number, I don't never pick up 
 I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
 I'm going big, suck my dick 
  
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes  
 
 I remember when I came out and shit 
 Man, it's been so long since they see my dick 
 Probably been five months since I seen my seed 
 Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this? 
 When I was sleeping on couches 
 Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch 
 Nigga I was motherfuckin' out, yeah 
 With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer 
 When I should have been making bank, yeah 
 I was somewhere stuck where the flame is 
 Motherfucker, see how far that I came here 
 Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah? 
 Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride 
 Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind 
 Feel my pain, now I'm styling, HermÃ¨s shit, I spent a thousand 
 Different homes, different islands 
 Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album  
 
 Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick 
 Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick (Yeah)  
 
 Too many niggas, not enough hoes 
 And some of you niggas, acting like hoes 
 Stay to myself like loners do 
 Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood 
 To politic or be fake with you 
 We apologize if you ever knew 
 Too many niggas, and not enough hoes 
 And most of you niggas, acting like hoes  
 
 Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes 
 Like hoes, nigga acting like a hoe 
 Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes 
 You acting like a hoe, you acting like a hoe 
 You acting like a hoe, niggas acting like a hoe 
 Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes"
